This video will introduce the
event-driven stochastic simulation tool
Warteschlangensimulator

00:05.100 --> 00:10.000
and show how to create a first
model and how to animate it.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Warteschlangensimulator allows to model
queueing networks in form of flow charts.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.500
These flow charts can be animated and
simulated for analysis of the performance
indicators.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Lets start with a simple M/M/1 model.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
We need these three stations:
Source
Process station
Exit

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
They can be found in the templates panel
and from there dragged to the drawing surface.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
Next we need to connect the stations by edges.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
Edges are added by clicking on the source
station and then on the destination station
of the connection.

01:37.000 --> 01:47.000
Now lets add 1 operator to
the process station.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
As the last step before starting the animation
we will check the inter-arrival times and the
service times.

02:12.100 --> 02:18.000
We have got c=1 operator, so we need
lambda&lt;mu to ensure rho&lt;1. This means the
average inter-arrival time E[I] needs to be
larger than the average service time E[S].

02:18.500 --> 02:36.000
We can check E[I] and E[S] just from the
right-click context menu.

02:38.000 --> 02:52.000
We have got E[I]=60 and E[S]=50 so everything is fine.
Lets start the animation of the model.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
We can change speed of a running animation.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
In stepping mode the simulator shows
detail information on the events
just being executed.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
While animation mode is to understand
what happens in the model (and for fun),

03:32.100 --> 03:37.000
the simulation mode is for fast simulation
of many arrivals.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
When simulation is done
(in this example simulation
of 10,000,000 arrivals in less
than 2 seconds)

03:47.500 --> 03:55.000
the recorded performance indicators
will be shown automatically.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Adding visualizations to the model for displaying
current values in the animation is also very easy.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Thank you for watching this video.
