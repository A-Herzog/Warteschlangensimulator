This video shows how to run
a parameter study in
Warteschlangensimulator.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.000
In many cases not a single fixed model
is to be analyzed but the influence of an
input parameter on the performance
indicators is of interest.

00:12.100 --> 00:16.000
This model is a built-in example.
It can be loaded via File|Load example.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.500
This is a simple M/M/1 model with E[I]=100.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
Lets change E[S] in the range from
60 to 95 and see what happens.

00:47.500 --> 00:54.000
This is real simulation time.
5,000,000 arrivals for each model.
Simulation was performed on a Ryzen 7 3700X.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
We see: E[W] increases exponentially
when E[S] (and therefore rho) increases.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.500
... with just 8 seconds of simulation time
and with only a few clicks.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Thank you for watching this video.
