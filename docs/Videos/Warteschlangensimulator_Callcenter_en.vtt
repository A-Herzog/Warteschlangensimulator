This video shows the animation
of a call center model in
Warteschlangensimulator.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.000
The animated call center model consists
of 3 different caller types and 3 call centers
with single and multi skill agents.

00:11.100 --> 00:18.000
Additionally the clients will have a limited
waiting time tolerance, will retry if they
canceled waiting and may get forwarded after
talking to an agent.

00:18.100 --> 00:24.000
This model is a built-in example.
It can be loaded via File|Load example.
