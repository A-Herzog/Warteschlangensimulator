\part{Java commands reference}

Scripts can be used at different points in the simulator.
The script language is \textbf{Javascript} or \textbf{Java}.

In this section the additional \textbf{Java} commands which
are available when using Java to access the
simulation or statistics data and to output filtered data are
presented.

The \textbf{Java} code has to be embedded in a
\begin{verbatim}
void function(SimulationInterface sim) {

}
\end{verbatim}
method. In addition to the standard language commands you can access
the simulation or statistics data depending on the context in which the script is executed
via the \texttt{SimulationInterface} interface which is given as a parameter.
The \texttt{SimulationInterface} has some methods which allow to get sub-interfaces
which offer these data:



\chapter{\texttt{StatisticsInterface} accessible via \texttt{sim.getStatistics()}}

The \texttt{sim.getStatistics()} methods returns a {StatisticsInterface} interface
which offers read access to the xml elements which are the base of the statistics data.
The \texttt{StatisticsInterface} interface is only available after the
simulation while filtering the results while and when running a parameter series scripts.
