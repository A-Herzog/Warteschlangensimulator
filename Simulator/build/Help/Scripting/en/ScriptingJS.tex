\part{Javascript commands reference}

Scripts can be used at different points in the simulator.
The script language is \textbf{Javascript} or \textbf{Java}.

In this section the additional \textbf{Javascript} commands which
are available when using Javascript to access the
simulation or statistics data and to output filtered data are
presented.



\chapter{\texttt{Statistics} object}

The \cmd{Statistics} object offers read access to the xml elements which are the

Th \cmd{Model} object is only available during parameter series
script execution and offers functions for accessing the model
properties and for starting simulations.

\begin{itemize}

\item
\cmd{Model.reset()}:\\
Resets the model to the initial state.

\item
\cmd{Model.run()}:\\
Simulates the current model.
The results can be accessed by the \cmd{Statistics} object after the simulation.

\item
\cmd{Model.setDistributionParameter("{}Path",Index,Value)}:\\
Sets the distribution parameter \cm{Index} (from 1 to 4) of the distribution referred
to by \cm{Path}.

\item
\cmd{Model.setMean("{}Path",Value)}:\\
Sets the mean of the distribution referred to by \cm{Path} to the specified value.

\item
\cmd{Model.setSD("{}Path",Value)}:\\
Sets the standard deviation of the distribution referred to by \cm{Path} to the specified value.  

\item
\cmd{Model.setString("{}Path","{}Text)"}:\\
Writes the string \cm{Text} to the location referred to by \cm{Path}.

\item
\cmd{Model.setValue("{}Path",Value)}:\\
Writes the number \cm{Value} to the location referred to by \cm{Path}.

\item
\cmd{Model.xml("{}Path")}:\\
Loads the xml field which is specified by the parameter and returns the data 
as String. This function is the equivalent of \cmd{Statistics.xml("{}Path")} for models.

\item
\cmd{Model.getResourceCount("{}ResourceName")}:\\
Gets the number of operations in the resource with name \cm{ResourceName}.
If the resource does not exist or is not defined by a fixed number of operators
the function will return -1.

\item
\cmd{Model.setResourceCount("{}ResourceName",Count)}:\\
Sets the number of operations in the resource with name \cm{ResourceName}.

\item
\cmd{Model.getGlobalVariableInitialValue("{}VariableName")}:\\
Gets the expression by which the initial value of the global variable with
name \cm{VariableName} is calculated. If the is no global variable with
this name the function will return an empty string.

\item
\cmd{Model.setGlobalVariableInitialValue("{}VariableName","{}Expression")}:\\
Sets the expression by which the initial value of the global variable with
name \cm{VariableName} is calculated.

\item
\cmd{Model.getGlobalMapInitialValue("{}VariableName")}:\\
Gets the initial value of the entry \cm{VariablenName} of the global map.
If there is no entry with this name, \cm{null} will be returned.

\item
\cmd{Model.setGlobalMapInitialValue("{}VariableName","{}Expression")}:\\
Sets the initial value (of type \cm{Integer}, \cm{Long}, \cm{Double} oder \cm{String}) of the key \cm{VariablenName}
in the global map.

\item
\cmd{Model.cancel()}:\\
Sets the cancel status. (When processing is canceled to further simulations will be performed.)

\end{itemize}

\section{Accessing station data}

\begin{itemize}

\item
\cmd{Model.getStationID("{}StationName")}:\\
Gets the ID of a station based on its name.
If there is no station with a matching name, the function will return -1.

\end{itemize}

\section{Retrieve the associated statistics file}

\begin{itemize}

\item
\cmd{Statistics.getStatisticsFile()}:\\
Returns the full path and file name of the statistics file from which the data was loaded.
If the statistic data was not loaded from a file, an empty string is returned.

\item
\cmd{Statistics.getStatisticsFileName()}:\\
Returns the file name of the statistics file from which the data was loaded.
If the statistic data was not loaded from a file, an empty string is returned.

\end{itemize}



\chapter{XML selection commands}

By the parameters of the functions of the \cmd{Statistics} object the content of the
value or of an attribute of an XML element can be read.
The selection of an XML element is done multistaged step by step divided by
"\texttt{->}" characters. Between the "\texttt{->}" characters the names of the individual XML nodes are
noted. In addition in square brackets names and values of attributes can be specified to filter by whom.

Examples:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\cmd{Statistics.xml("{}Model->ModellName")}:\\
Shows the content of the element \cm{ModelName}, which is a child element of \cm{Model}.

\item
\cmd{Statistics.xml("{}StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients->\\{}Station[Type=$\backslash$"{}Source id=1$\backslash$"]->[Mean]")}:\\
Selects the \cm{Station} sub element of the \cm{StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients} element, for
which the \cm{Type} attribute is set to \cm{Source id=1}. And returns the value of the
\cm{Mean} attribute.

\end{itemize}
