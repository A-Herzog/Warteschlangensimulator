<h2>Allen-Cunneen</h2>

<p>
The Allen-Cunneen formula, in contrast to the Erlang formulas, is only
an <b>approximate formula</b>. This means that the results that this formula
provides will not be absolutely identical to reality, even if all the
conditions for using the formula are met.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the Erlang formulas, the Allen-Cunneen queueing model no longer
assumes that inter-arrival times and the service times are distributed exponentially.
Instead, <b>any distributions</b> are now allowed, which are characterized only by
their <b>expected values</b> (&lambda; or &mu; as reciprocals of the expected values)
and their <b>coefficients of variation</b> (CV[I] and CV[S]). Furthermore, the clients
can arrive in groups (<b>arrival batch size b(I)</b>) and be served in groups
(<b>service batch size b(S)</b>).

<h3>Correction factors</h3>

<p>
Da es sich bei der Allen-Cunneen Formel um eine Näherungsformel handelt,
bestehen in vielen Fällen Abweichungen zwischen den Formelergebnissen und
den realen Ergebnissen. Daher existieren mehrere Ansätze zur Korrektur
der Ergebnisse. Die Korrekturterme wirken bei Variationskoeffizienten
ungleich 1 (Krämer, Langenbach-Belz, 1976) und bei Batch-Größen größer
als 1 (Hanschke, 2006).

Since the Allen-Cunneen formula is an approximation formula, in many cases
there are deviations between the formula results and the real results.
Therefore, several approaches exist to correct the results.
The correction terms are effective for coefficients of variation
not equal to 1 (Krämer, Langenbach-Belz, 1976) and for batch sizes
larger than 1 (Hanschke, 2006).

<h3>Performance indicators</h3>

<p>
The following parameters are calculated on the basis of the inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Offered work load a</b>:
  This value indicates how many operators are needed in any case to serve
  the arriving clients on a long-term average. The offered work load is the
  quotient of the arrival and service rate: a=&lambda;/&mu;.</li>
  <li><b>Work load &rho;</b>:
  The work load is the quotient of offered work load and the specified number
  of operators (&rho;=a/c). The work load must always be &lt;1, so that the
  operators can serve the arriving clients on a long-term average. However,
  a work load of less than 1 alone is not a statement that the system is sensibly
  dimensioned, since the work load does not provide any information about how
  long the clients will have to wait on average in the system.</li>
  <li><b>Average queue length E[N<sub>Q</sub>]</b>:
  The average queue length indicates the average number of clients waiting
  (i.e. not yet served) in a correspondingly configured system.</li>
  <li><b>Average number of clients in the system E[N]</b>:
  This value indicates the average total number of clients in the system,
  i.e. it is the sum of waiting and currently served clients.</li>
  <li><b>Average waiting time E[W]</b>:
  Using Little's formula, the average queue length E [N<sub>Q</sub>]
  (and the arrival rate &lambda;) can be used to calculate how long clients
  will have to wait on average before they are served.</li>
  <li><b>Average residence time E[V]</b>:
  The residence time is the sum of the average waiting time E[W] and the average
  service time E[S]. The average service time is the reciprocal of the service rate
  (E[S]=1/&mu;).</li>
  <li><b>Flow factor E[V]/E[S]</b>:
  The flow factor is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
  Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
  Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
  waiting time has occurred. Large values indicate a relatively long waiting time.</li>
</ul>
