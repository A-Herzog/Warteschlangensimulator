<h2>Allen-Cunneen</h2>

<p>
The Allen-Cunneen formula, in contrast to the Erlang formulas, is only
an <b>approximate formula</b>. This means that the results that this formula
provides will not be absolutely identical to reality, even if all the
conditions for using the formula are met.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the Erlang formulas, the Allen-Cunneen queueing model no longer
assumes that inter-arrival times and the service times are distributed exponentially.
Instead, <b>any distributions</b> are now allowed, which are characterized only by
their <b>expected values</b> (&lambda; or &mu; as reciprocals of the expected values)
and their <b>coefficients of variation</b> (CV[I] and CV[S]). Furthermore, the clients
can arrive in groups (<b>arrival batch size b(I)</b>) and be served in groups
(<b>service batch size b(S)</b>).

<h3>Performance indicators</h3>

<p>
The following parameters are calculated on the basis of the inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Offered work load a</b>:
  This value indicates how many operators are needed in any case to serve
  the arriving clients on a long-term average. The offered work load is the
  quotient of the arrival and service rate: a=&lambda;/&mu;.</li>
  <li><b>Work load &rho;</b>:
  The work load is the quotient of offered work load and the specified number
  of operators (&rho;=a/c). The work load must always be &lt;1, so that the
  operators can serve the arriving clients on a long-term average. However,
  a work load of less than 1 alone is not a statement that the system is sensibly
  dimensioned, since the work load does not provide any information about how
  long the clients will have to wait on average in the system.</li>
  <li><b>Average queue length E[N<sub>Q</sub>]</b>:
  The average queue length indicates the average number of clients waiting
  (i.e. not yet served) in a correspondingly configured system.</li>
  <li><b>Average number of clients in the system E[N]</b>:
  This value indicates the average total number of clients in the system,
  i.e. it is the sum of waiting and currently served clients.</li>
  <li><b>Average waiting time E[W]</b>:
  Using Little's formula, the average queue length E [N<sub>Q</sub>]
  (and the arrival rate &lambda;) can be used to calculate how long clients
  will have to wait on average before they are served.</li>
  <li><b>Average residence time E[V]</b>:
  The residence time is the sum of the average waiting time E[W] and the average
  service time E[S]. The average service time is the reciprocal of the service rate
  (E[S]=1/&mu;).</li>
</ul>
