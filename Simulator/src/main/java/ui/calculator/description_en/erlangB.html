<h2>Erlang B</h2>

<p>
The Erlang-B formula assumes that there is no waiting room in the model,
so that clients are rejected to enter the system if they cannot be served directly.
</p>

<p>
Since the Erlang-B formula originally comes from the telecommunications sector,
we are not talking about the number of operators here, but about the <b>number of lines N</b>.
The quantity <b>a</b> indicates the work load - in this context also called <b>offered work load</b>.
This value, the quotient of the arrival rate and the service rate, indicates how many operators or
lines are required in any case in order to be able to serve the arriving clients in the long term.
</p>

<p>
The displayed value <b>P(B)</b> indicates the probability of an
incoming client to encounter the system in a state in which there
are already <b>N</b> clients in the system (i.e. all lines are busy).
In this case, the new client is immediately rejected. When dimensioning
a communications system in practice, the aim is to keep P(B) as small as possible.
