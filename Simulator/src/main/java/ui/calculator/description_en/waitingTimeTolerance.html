<h2>Waiting time tolerance</h2>

<p>
The waiting time tolerance of the clients in a real system cannot be measured directly.
It is only known from the wait cancellers how long they have been willing to wait.
Only a lower estimate of the waiting time tolerance is known from the successful clients:
They were apparently willing to wait in any case as long as it was necessary for them to
be served. The reasonable estimation of the waiting time tolerance (which is necessary,
for example, to use the extended Erlang-C formula) is therefore a difficult problem.
</p>

<p>
One possible approach is to assume that the waiting time tolerances are exponentially
distributed (which is also assumed by the extended Erlang-C formula anyway).
In this case, the <b>average waiting time tolerance E[WT]</b> can be determined directly
as the quotient of the <b>average waiting time of the clients E[W]</b> and the
<b>cancelation rate P(A)</b>.
