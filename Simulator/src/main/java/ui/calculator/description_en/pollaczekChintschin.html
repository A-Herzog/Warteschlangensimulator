<h2>Pollaczek窶適hinchine</h2>

<p>
The Pollaczek窶適hinchine formula allows the calculation of exact values
for the characteristics in a queueing system with non-exponentially
distributed service times. (The Erlang C formula assumes
exponential distribution for both inter-arrival and service times.
The Allen-Cunneen formula, on the other hand, which does not specify
the distribution type for inter-arrival and service times, is only
an approximation formula). For this, however,
the Pollaczek窶適hinchine formula is only applicable for the case of
a single operator system (c=1).

<h3>Performance indicators</h3>

<p>
The following parameters are calculated on the basis of the inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Offered work load a / work load &rho;</b>:
  Since a single operator system is considered, we have
  a=&rho;=&lambda;/&mu;. The work load has always be &lt;1, so that the
  operator can serve the arriving clients on a long-term average. However,
  a work load of less than 1 alone is not a statement that the system is sensibly
  dimensioned, since the work load does not provide any information about how
  long the clients will have to wait on average in the system.</li>
  <li><b>Average number of clients in the system E[N]</b>:
  This value indicates the average total number of clients in the system,
  i.e. it is the sum of waiting and currently served clients.</li>
  <li><b>Average waiting time E[W]</b>:
  Using Little's formula, the average queue length E [N<sub>Q</sub>]
  (and the arrival rate &lambda;) can be used to calculate how long clients
  will have to wait on average before they are served.</li>
  <li><b>Average residence time E[V]</b>:
  The residence time is the sum of the average waiting time E[W] and the average
  service time E[S]. The average service time is the reciprocal of the service rate
  (E[S]=1/&mu;).</li>
  <li><b>Flow factor E[V]/E[S]</b>:
  The flow factor is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
  Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
  Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
  waiting time has occurred. Large values indicate a relatively long waiting time.</li>
</ul>
