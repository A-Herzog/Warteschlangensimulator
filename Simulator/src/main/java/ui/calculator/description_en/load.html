<h2>Work load</h2>

<p>
The <b>work load</b> &rho; of a queueing system is the
quotient of the <b>arrival rate</b> &lambda; on the one hand
and the product of <b>service rate</b> &mu; and the
<b>number of operators</b> c on the other.
</p>
<p>
In order for a queueing system to be stable in the long term,
&rho;&lt;1 must apply, i.e. fewer clients must arrive than
the operators can serve.
</p>
<p>
If one resolves the formula <b>&rho;=&lambda;/(c&middot;&mu;)</b>
to <b>c</b>, the result is: <b>c=&lambda;/(&rho;&middot;&mu;)</b>.
In this way, it is possible to determine how many operators are
required to achieve a given work load with a known arrival and
a known service rate.
</p>

<h3>Limits of the calculation</h3>
<p>
This calculation does not take into account that the actual
arrivals are at random times and that the actual service times
vary in length. Therefore, the above calculation does not provide
any information about how long the waiting times would be in such a system.
