<h2>Erlang C</h2>

<p>
The Erlang-C formula represents the standard formula for calculating the
characteristics in simple queueing models. The prerequisite for using the
Erlang-C formula is a model structured as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exponential distributed inter-arrival times</li>
  <li>Exponential distributed service times</li>
  <li>A fixed number of operators</li>
  <li>No other special properties</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance indicators</h3>

<p>
The following parameters are calculated on the basis of the inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Offered work load a</b>:
  This value indicates how many operators are needed in any case to serve
  the arriving clients on a long-term average. The offered work load is the
  quotient of the arrival and service rate: a=&lambda;/&mu;.</li>
  <li><b>Work load &rho;</b>:
  The work load is the quotient of offered work load and the specified number
  of operators (&rho;=a/c). The work load must always be &lt;1, so that the
  operators can serve the arriving clients on a long-term average. However,
  a work load of less than 1 alone is not a statement that the system is sensibly
  dimensioned, since the work load does not provide any information about how
  long the clients will have to wait on average in the system.</li>  
  <li><b>P1</b>:
  This value is an auxiliary variable that occurs in the Erlang-C formula.
  It is only significant if you want to calculate manually with the partial results.</li>  
  <li><b>Average queue length E[N<sub>Q</sub>]</b>:
  The average queue length indicates the average number of clients waiting
  (i.e. not yet served) in a correspondingly configured system.</li>
  <li><b>Average number of clients in the system E[N]</b>:
  This value indicates the average total number of clients in the system,
  i.e. it is the sum of waiting and currently served clients.</li>
  <li><b>Average waiting time E[W]</b>:
  Using Little's formula, the average queue length E [N<sub>Q</sub>]
  (and the arrival rate &lambda;) can be used to calculate how long clients
  will have to wait on average before they are served.</li>
  <li><b>Average residence time E[V]</b>:
  The residence time is the sum of the average waiting time E[W] and the average
  service time E[S]. The average service time is the reciprocal of the service rate
  (E[S]=1/&mu;).</li>
  <li><b>Flow factor E[V]/E[S]</b>:
  The flow factor is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
  Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
  Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
  waiting time has occurred. Large values indicate a relatively long waiting time.</li>
  <li><b>Service level P(W&le;t)</b>:
  Frequently, one is not only interested in the average waiting time of clients,
  but also in the proportion of clients who had to wait for a certain, predetermined
  period of time at most. This information is provided by the service level.
  P(W&le;t) is the proportion of clients who had to wait at most t seconds.</li>
  <li><b>Waiting probability P(W&gt;0)</b>:
  The waiting probability indicates the probability with which a newly arriving
  client has to wait at all before being served.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>
In contrast to a simulation, the Erlang-C formula provides exact results with a very
low computational effort. However, the results only describe reality accurately if
the above properties are exactly fulfilled. Especially the following properties are
often critical in reality:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The service times are usually not exponentially distributed, but are subject
  to a different distribution with usually a different coefficient of variation than
  is the case with the exponential distribution (there always CV[S]=1).</li>
  <li>Clients are not willing to wait for any amount of time and will leave the system
  (without having been served) if the waiting time becomes too long. This is called
  impatience and is a sign that the clients have only a limited waiting time tolerance.
  (This aspect can be addressed with the extended Erlang C formula).</li>
  <li>Several clients are served simultaneously (batch service), the clients are
  divided into different types with different service times or the number of
  operators varies over time.</li>
  <li>Also network effects ( waiting cancelers start another attempt later, already
  served clients are referred again to the queue or several stations play together)
  are not mapped by the Erlang-C formula.</li>  
</ul>
