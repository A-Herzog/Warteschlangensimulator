<h1>Add process station</h1>

<p>
In most cases, one or more process stations are the core of the simulation model.
At the process stations the <b>queues</b> exist and the clients are served by the
<b>operators</b>. (Again, neither the "clients" nor the "operators" have to be people.
Also workpieces can arrive as clients which are to be operated by machines).

left mouse button to the drawing surface.
