<h1>Setup source</h1>

<p>
At most stations, it is possible to configure how clients are to be processed.
In a process station, e.g. one can setup how long the service process should last,
and at a client source can be set, how many clients are to be generated, at which
inter-arrival times and of which types.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to configure the <b>source</b>. The configuration dialog
of an element can be opened by double clicking on it. The following settings
can be made in the source configuration dialog:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b>:
  The name of the source also determines the type of clients that are generated in it.
  Here you can enter any name or keep the previous name. The field may not be empty.</li>
  <li><b>Calculation of the inter-arrival times</b>:
  This selection field can be used to specify whether the inter-arrival times should
  be defined by a probability distribution, an expression or a schedule.
  <span style="color: green;">In this example we will keep the value "Probability distribution".</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Time base</b>:
  When determining the inter-arrival times by means of a probability distribution or an expression,
  it can be set whether the respective numerical value is to be interpreted as the number of
  seconds, minutes or hours.<span style="color: green;">The default value "seconds"
  can also be retained here.</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Distribution</b>:
  By clicking "Edit" button on the right above the probability distribution the distribution
  can be edited. <span style="color: orange;">In the example model, the exponential distribution
  is to be maintained, but the average distance between two arrivals should be 50 seconds.</span> 
  </li>
  <li><b>Number of clients per arrival event</b>:
  At each arrival event multiple clients can arrive (batch arrival).
  <span style="color: green;">In this example the batch size of 1 should be maintained.</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Number of arrival events in total</b>:
  The number of arrival events that this source generates can generally be limited.
  <span style="color: green;">In this example no limitation of the number of arrivals is to be made.</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Start time for the first inter-arrival time</b>:
  Optionally, you can specify that the source will start generating arrivals only from a certain point in time.
  <span style="color: green;">In this example the start time 0 is to be maintained.</span> 
  </li>
</ul> 

<p><b>Concrete steps:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Double click on the source:<br>
<img src="Source.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></li>
<li>In the dialog, click <b>Edit</b> on the right side of the distribution diagram and select
<b>50</b> (seconds) as the average inter-arrival time in the distribution editor.
(Keep the exponential distribution as the inter-arrival time distribution.)</li>
<li>Close the distribution editor and the dialog for editing the source with "Ok".</li>
</ul>
