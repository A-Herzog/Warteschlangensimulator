<h1>Setup process station</h1>

<p>
At most stations, it is possible to configure how clients are to be processed.
In a process station, e.g. one can setup how long the service process should last,
and at a client source can be set, how many clients are to be generated, at which
interarrival times and of which types.
</p>

<p>
After configuring the source, the <b>process station</b> has to be
configured. (The exit element has no settings.) The configuration dialog
of an element is opened by double-clicking on the element.
The process station configuration dialog consists of several pages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Processing times</b>:
  <span style="color: orange;">Set an exponentially distributed with average duration of 80 seconds here,</span>
  similar to the source.
  <span style="color: green;">Time base (seconds) and recording the delay times as process times can be kept without any change.</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Setup times</b>:
  When serving clients of different types may be setup times between clients of different types are needed.  
  <span style="color: green;">In this example, setup times should be kept disabled.</span> 
  </li>  
  <li><b>Post processing times</b>:
  After a client has been served, a post processing time may be necessary before the operator will be available again.  
  <span style="color: green;">In this example, post processing times should be kept disabled.</span> 
  </li>
  <li><b>Waiting time tolerances</b>:
  If a client has to wait too long, he may cancels waiting (because his waiting time tolerance has been exceeded).
  <span style="color: green;">In this example, the waiting time tolerances should be kept disabled.</span> 
  </li>
  <li><b>Priorities and batch sizes</b>:
  On this page you can specify by which strategy clients are taken from the queue and whether batch operations
  are to be performed. The selection order "w" means a priorization of the clients by their waiting times,
  that is, using a FIFO queue.
  <span style="color: green;">In this example, the value "w" should be maintained for the priority determination of the clients and a batch size of 1.</span> 
  </li>
  <li><b>Operators</b>:
  This page can be used to determine which numbers of which types of operators are required to serve a client.
  <span style="color: orange;">Click "Add needed operators group" and confirm with "OK" to create a group consisting
  of one operator and add it as a necessary operator group.</span>
  </li>
  <li><b>Costs</b>:
  On this page you can optionally set costs for the operations.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Concrete steps:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Double click on the process station:<br>
<img src="Process.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></li>
<li>On the "<b>Processing times</b>" page click on <b>Edit</b> above the distribution diagram and select
<b>80</b> (seconds) as the average operating time.</li>
<li>On the "<b>Operators</b>" page, click "<b>Add needed operators group</b>", and close the dialog by clicking on "OK".</li>
</ul>
