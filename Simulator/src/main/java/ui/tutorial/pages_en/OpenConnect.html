<h1>Connect elements</h1>

<p>
In order to connect the elements of the queueing model and thus describe the path of
the clients through the system, so-called <b>edges</b> are used. An edge always has 
a source and a destination element and is symbolized by an arrow. Contrary to elements,
edges can not exist independently. If the source or the destination element of an edge
is deleted, the edge will also disappear.
</p>

<p>
To add an edge to the model, the edge function has to be activated in the vertical toolbar
on the left side of the main window. To do this, click the "Edge" button in the toolbar on the left.
