<h1>Setup model</h1>

<p>
In the previous steps an average inter-arrival time of 50
seconds and an average processing time of 80 seconds per client
was defined. Furthermore, an operator group consisting of one
operator was created strait from the setup dialog of the process station.
(And was set that to one operator is needed to serve one client.)
</p>

<p>
At the moment therefore there is an overload in the model.
So the number of available operators in the operator group
needs to be increased from 1 to 2.
</p>

<p>
All resources and many more model related setting can be
adjusted in the <b>Model properties</b> dialog. This dialog
has several tabs. We select the tab "Operators" tab and increase
the number of operators in the pre-defined operators group from
1 to 2.
