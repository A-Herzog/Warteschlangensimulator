<h1>Export client movements as Sankey diagram dialog</h1>

<p>
If recording the <b>station transitions</b> or <b>client path recording</b>
was activated (see <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">Model properties dialog</a>),
by the corresponding statistics pages the dialog for creating a Sankey diagram
can be opened. In a Sankey diagram the paths of the clients through the system
are represented by connections between the stations of different wides.
The client paths contain more information than the station transition counting
so using them for creating Sankey diagrams will result in more detailed
diagrams.
