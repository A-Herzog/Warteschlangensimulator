<h1>Model element: Connection vertex</h1>

<p>
<a href="ModelElementEdge.html">Connection edges</a> always run in a straight line from the output component
to the target component. In order to be able to present the sequences more clearly, connection vertices can be used.
One or more edges can run into a connecting vertex, and one edge can - if necessary in a different direction - run out
of the connecting vertex. In this way, paths can be optically deflected.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
Connection vertices have no properties. Also, a connection vertex can not get a name.
