<h1>Javas Scripting</h1>

<p>
Scripts can be used at different locations in the simulator.
As scripting language <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Java</b> can be used in all cases.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Java</b> code has to be embedded in a
<pre>
void function(SimulationInterface sim) {
}
</pre>
method. In addition to the standard language commands you can access
the simulation or statistics data depending on the context in which the script is executed
via the <tt>SimulationInterface</tt> interface which is given as a parameter.
The <tt>SimulationInterface</tt> has some methods which allow to get sub-interfaces
which offer these data:
</p>

<h2>StatisticsInterface accessible via sim.getStatistics()</h2>

<p>
The <tt>sim.getStatistics()</tt> methods returns a <tt>StatisticsInterface</tt> interface
which offers read access to the xml elements which are the base of the statistics data.
The <tt>StatisticsInterface</tt> interface is only available after the
simulation while filtering the results while and when running a parameter series scripts.
The following methods are in this object available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>void setFormat(final String format)</tt><br>
  This command allows to setup the format that is used in <tt>Statistics.xml</tt> for outputing numbers
  as strings. You can specify whether to use a floating point notation or percent notation or interpreting
  the value as a time. As default floating point notation is used.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>"System"</tt>: Using floating point notation for numbers and percent values</li>
    <li><tt>"Fraction"</tt>: Using floating point notation for numbers (<tt>0.375</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Percent":</tt> Using percent notation for numbers (<tt>35.7%</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Time"</tt>: Interpreting numbers as times (<tt>00:03:25.87</tt> for example)</li>

<h2>OutputInterface accessible via sim.getOutput()</h2>

<p>
The <tt>OutputInterface</tt> interface provides functions for output of filtered results:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>void setFormat(final String format)</tt><br>
  This command allows to setup the format that is used in <tt>print</tt> and <tt>println</tt>
  for outputing numbers as strings. You can specify whether to use a floating point notation or percent notation or interpreting
  the value as a time. As default floating point notation is used.
  <ul>    
    <li><tt>"Fraction"</tt>: Using floating point notation for numbers (<tt>0.375</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Percent":</tt> Using percent notation for numbers (<tt>35.7%</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Number"</tt>: Interpreting numbers as normal number values (decimal or percent).</li>
    <li><tt>"Time"</tt>: Interpreting numbers as time values.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>  
  <li><tt>void setSeparator(final String separator)</tt><br>
  This command allows to select the separator to be used when printing out arrays.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>"Semicolon"</tt>: Semicolons as separators</tt>

    <li><tt>"Tabs"</tt>: Tabulators as separators</tt>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><tt>void setDigits(final int digits)</tt><br>
  This command allows to define the number of digits to be displayed when
  printing a number in local notation. A negative value means that all
  available digits are being printed.
  (If the system notation is used, always all available digits are being printed.)
  </li>
  <li><tt>void print(final Object obj)</tt><br>
  Outputs the passed expression.
  Strings will be written directly. Numbers are formated according to the format
  defined via <tt>setFormat</tt>.
  </li>
  <li><tt>void println(final Object obj)</tt><br>
  Outputs the passed expression and adds a line break after the expression.
  Strings will be written directly. Numbers are formated according to the format
  defined via <tt>setFormat</tt>.
  </li>
  <li><tt>void newLine()</tt><br>
  Outputs a line break. This functions is equivalent to calling
  <tt>println("")</tt>.  
  </li>
  <li><tt>void tab()</tt><br>
  Outputs a tabulator.
  </li>
  <li><tt>void cancel()</tt><br>
  Sets the cancel status. (When output is canceled to further file output will be performed.)
  </li>
  <li><tt>printlnDDE(final String workbook, final String table, final String cell, final Object obj)</tt><br>
  This command is only available if DDE is available, i.e. under Windows.
  It outputs the passed expression via DDE in the specified table in Excel.
  Numbers are formated according to the format defined via <tt>setFormat</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>FileOutputInterface accessible via sim.getFileOutput()</h2>

<p>
The <tt>FileOutputInterface</tt> interface offers all function the <tt>Output</tt> has
but is only available when running a parameter series script. In opposite
to the <tt>Output</tt> interface the output of the <tt>FileOutput</tt> interface
is not written to the default output but is appended to a file which has
to be specified by <tt>sim.getFileOutput().setFile("Filename")</tt> before.
</p>



<h2>ModelInterface accessible via sim.getModel()</h2>

<p>
The <tt>ModelInterface</tt> interface is only available during parameter series
script execution and offers functions for accessing the model
properties and for starting simulations.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>void reset()</tt><br>
  Resets the model to the initial state.
  </li>
  <li><tt>void run()</tt><br>
  Simulates the current model.
  The results can be accessed by the <tt>StatisticsInterface</tt> interface after the simulation.
  </li>
  <li><tt>boolean setDistributionParameter(final String xmlName, final int number, final double value)</tt><br>
  Sets the distribution parameter <tt>number</tt> (from 1 to 4) of the distribution referred
  to by <tt>xmlName</tt>.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li><tt>String xml(final String xmlName)</tt><br>

  for models.
  </li>
  <li><tt>getResourceCount(final String resourceName)</tt><br>
  Gets the number of operations in the resource with name <tt>resourceName</tt>.

</ul>



<h2>XML selection commands</h2>

<p>
By the parameters of the functions of the <tt>StatisticsInterface</tt> interface the content of the
value or of an attribute of an XML element can be read.
The selection of an XML element is done multistaged step by step divided by
"-&gt;" characters. Between the "-&gt;" characters the names of the individual XML nodes are
noted. In addition in square brackets names and values of attributes can be specified to filter by whom.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <tt>sim.getStatistics().xml("Model-&gt;ModelName")</tt><br>
    Shows the content of the element <tt>ModelName</tt>, which is a child element of <tt>Model</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>sim.getStatistics().xml("StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients-&gt;Station[Type=\"Source id=1\"]-&gt;[Mean]")</tt><br>
	Selects the <tt>Station</tt> sub element of the <tt>StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients</tt> element, for
	which the <tt>Type</tt> attribute is set to <tt>Source id=1</tt>. And returns the value of the
	<tt>Mean</tt> attribute.
  </li>
</ul>
