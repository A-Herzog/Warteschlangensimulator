<h1>Model element: Output (Script)</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, some status information definable via
a Javascript or a Jaava program are written to an output file.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the output element has no further meaning. The name of the file to which the data is to be written
can be specified using the filename field. The script commands to be executed are defined in <b>Javascript</b>
or in <b>Java</b>. Next to the default Javascript and Java commands some
<a href="JS.html">additional Javascript commands</a> or <a href="Java.html">additional Java commands</a>
are available for accessing the simulation data.
</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>
The definition of script defined output allows maximum flexibility, but takes a comparatively long
computing time. A faster option for writing out simulation data is to use the
<a href="ModelElementOutput.html">Output</a> element.
