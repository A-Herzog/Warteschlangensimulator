<h1>Model element: Process station</h1>

<p>
The process station is the central element of each simulation model. In an process station, clients wait for an operator
to become available and then are served by this operator for a certain time. Clients whose (optional) limited waiting time
tolerance has been exceeded will cancel waiting without having been served. An operator (also optionally) can go into
a post-processing time after serving a client, before he is again ready to serve the next client.
</p>

<p>
It can be stated that, instead of one operator, several operators are optionally required from several different groups
to serve a client.
</p>

<p>
Additionally it can also be set up that clients are not served individually, but in groups.
In this case, the necessary numbers of operators refer to operating a whole group.
</p>  

<h2>Settings</h2>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
The name of the process station element has no further meaning.
</p>

<h3>Processing times</h3>
<p>
On this dialog page, the probability distribution or the expression for the clients's processing times can be set.
Optionally, an individual distribution or expressions can be defined for each client type.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note on individual processing times and batch processing:</u><br>
In principle, individual client processing times and the simultaneous operation of several clients
(of possibly different types) contradict each. Nevertheless, this can be used in the simulation.
In this case, an processing time according to the predefined distribution or the calculation expressing
is determined for each client type contained in the batch. This processing time then applies to all clients
in the batch of client's type. The resources are seized until the maximum of the processing times for all
clients included in the batch is reached. If the service time is determined via a calculation expression
and client-specific data is used in this, the evaluation (per client type) is carried out for the client
with the highest service priority.
</p>

<h3>Setup times</h3>
<p>
On this dialog page, additional times between the service processes of clients of the same
or - which is usually the case - of different types can be defined. These setup times,
which are optional for each client type transition, can be defined each using either a
probability distribution or an expression.
</p>

<p>
Option <b>Clients can also give up waiting during the setup time</b>:<br>
If this option is activated and waiting time tolerances are defined in addition
to setup times, clients can still cancel waiting if the setup time associated
with their service process has already started. Otherwise, client will not
cancel waiting within the setup time.	
</p>

<p>
<u>Note on setup times and batch processing:</u><br>
Setup times and batching cannot be used at the same time at one process station.
A process station with setup times can serve clients which are temporary or
permanently batched but creating batches directly at the process station is
not possible in this case, because the simulator would not be able to determine
which setup time is in charge in this case.
</p>

<h3>Post processing times</h3>
<p>
The optional post-processing times can be used to specify a probability distribution or an expression
according to which the operator will require additional time after the client has been served before they are
available to process the next client. Optionally, an individual distribution can also be set
for each client type.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note about individual post-processing times and batch processing:</u><br>
In principle, individual client post-processing times and the simultaneous operation of several clients
(of possibly different types) contradict each. Nevertheless, this can be used in the simulation.
In this case, an post-processing time according to the predefined distribution is determined for each
client type contained in the batch. The resources are seized until the maximum of the post-processing times
for all clients included in the batch is reached.
</p>

<h3>Waiting time tolerances</h3>
<p>
If the clients are only willing to wait for a limited period of time, a waiting time tolerance (based on a distribution
or on an expression) is determined for each client according to the waiting time tolerance distribution
(globally or optionally individual per client type). If this time is exceeded, the client cancels waiting and leaves
the system without being served.
</p>

<h3>Priorities and batch sizes</h3>
<p>
If more than one client is waiting and an operator is available, the client to be served next is determined by the 
priorities. The client with the highest priority will be served next. 
"w" indicates here the client's previous waiting time at the current station. (In all other cases "w" is the total
waiting time of the current client.) This means that the formula "w" for the priority results
in a first-in-first-out queue. "-w" would result in a last-in-first-out system.
</p>

<p>
The batch size indicates how many clients can be operated simultaneously by an operator. Obviously, the minimum batch
size can not be larger as the maximum batch size. If both values are identical, a fixed batch size is obtained.
If the minimum batch size is actually smaller than the maximum batch size, after waiting for this minimum number of
waiting customers, a millisecond is still waited to see if further customers arrive. Then at least as many clients
as before (= minimum batch size) and at most as many of the waiting clients as the maximum batch size are served.
</p>

<p>
In the default case, the service order is determined via the priority formulas (which can be set individually for each client type).
However, this can lead to very frequent changes of the client type. If setup times are used at an process station when changing the
client type, it may be desirable to serve as many clients of one type as possible in succession. This can be achieved by activating
the campaign mode. In this case, the evaluation of priorities is divided into two parts: First, an attempt is made to select the
client with the highest priority for service among the clients of the same type, as in the case of the last client served.
If no client of the same type as the type of the last served client is waiting, the priority formula-based search is extended
to all waiting clients.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note on variable batch sizes in the simulation:</u><br>
Clients are basically moving through the queueing network as individual objects.
As a result, when a variable batch size is used, the client group operation would theoretically always
start with the minimum batch size. - Even if the next client of the virtual batch would arrive immediately.
In order to accommodate this fact, the simulator waits a millisecond after the arrival of a client, which
increases the number of waiting clients to the minimum necessary batch size, so as to allow the addition
of further directly incoming clients to the batch.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note on batch service and campaign mode:</u><br>
A batch consists of several clients; the clients are arranged into service batches according to their priorities.
This means in particular that clients of different types can be in one batch. Therefore, batches cannot
be combined with the campaign mode, which requires that there is a unique type for the last served client.
</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>
To operate a client (or a client batch) several operators from several groups can be required.
The operation starts only if all necessary operators are available at the same time and all can be seized
simultaneously.
Additionally alternative group setups can be defined. All groups of one setup have to be available in order
to start the service of a client. 
It can be set whether the alternatives should be checked for availability in the defined order or in random order.
</p>

<p>
The resource priority can be used to determine the priority of this process station when a resource
which is necessary for processing the clients at this station becomes free. Larger values mean a
higher priority, or a higher probability, that this process station gets the appropriate resources
if there are multiple process stations that need the same resource.
</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>
On this page, you can optionally set the costs incurred by the clients. This are costs of the process station.
For the waiting, transfer and operating times costs per client can be defined in the clients settings for each
client type. Also the costs for allocation and availability of the resources can be defined in the resource settings.
</p>

<h2>Load client types</h2>

<p>
If a large number of client types with different settings is to be used at a station, this function can be used
to load several client type settings from a table. Each table line contains the data for one client type.
</p>

<p>
The first column specifies the name of the client type, the second the definition of the corresponding times.
Thereby the times can be defined either by a calculation expression or by the definition of a
distribution. The format of the distributions is documented in the pdf document
"Distribution XML reference for Warteschlangensimulator".
