<h1>Model element: Condition (script)</h1>

<p>
This element allows to hold and forward the incoming clients by using a
Javascript-based or Java-based condition.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The script code can contain any Javascript or Java commands as well as some
<a href="JS.html">special Javascript commands</a> or <a href="Java.html">special Java commands</a> 
for accessing the simulation system.
If the condition contains values that can change independently of events (e.g. the simulated time),
it may is necessary, to activate the option "Do additional time-based condition checks". In this case,
the value of the condition is additionally checked in certain time intervals. How long these intervals
are can be configured in the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">Model properties</a> dialog.
Additional time-based checks significantly slow down the simulation and should only be activated
if this is for the condition necessary.
