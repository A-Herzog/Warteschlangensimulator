<h1>Fit distribution dialog</h1>

<p>
The distribution fitting can be done in two ways: Either a single distribution function
(from a large set of possible distribution functions) can be selected that describes
the specified measured values as well as possible. Or the measured values can be assumed
as a superposition of several distributions (with a given, known type). The distribution
fitting then tries to extract the individual distributions from this multimodal measurement
series.
</p>

<h2>Determination of a single distribution function that describes the measured values as well as possible</h2>

<p>
The distribution fit function allows you to find a distribution based on a series of measured values
that best reflects the values. For this purpose, the mean value and the standard deviation of the
measured values are initially determined and distributing functions for all built-in probability
distributions are generated with these values. Finally, all these concrete distribution functions
are compared with the empirical distribution of the measured values and the deviation is determined
in each case. The distribution function, which has the smallest deviation from the measured values,
is recommended as an fitted distribution function.
</p>

<p>
In addition for all distributions p-values for various fitting tests are calculated.
The higher a p-value, the harder it is to reject the hypothesis that the measured samples are
based on the respective distribution. For all distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov fit test
and the Chi<sup>2</sup> fit test are performed. While the Kolmogorov-Smirnov fit test evaluates
the maximum deviations between the measured samples and distribution function,
the Chi<sup>2</sup> fit test considers the mean deviations. For the normal distribution,
the Anderson-Darling test, which is a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, is also performed.
</p>

<h2>Decomposition of a measurement series into several distributions</h2>

<p>
In this operating mode, one first has to select whether log-normal or gamma distributions
are to be used for the individual distributions. The distribution fitting then tries to
find successive distributions, each of which describes the measurement series as a whole
as well as possible. Such a partial distribution is then subtracted from the given overall
distribution and the algorithm is applied again to the remaining distribution.
This process is iterated until the sum of the partial distributions describes
at least 99% of the measurement distribution.
