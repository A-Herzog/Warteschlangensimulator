<h1>Fit distribution dialog</h1>

<p>
The distribution fit function allows you to find a distribution based on a series of measured values
that best reflects the values. For this purpose, the mean value and the standard deviation of the
measured values are initially determined and distributing functions for all built-in probability
distributions are generated with these values. Finally, all these concrete distribution functions
are compared with the empirical distribution of the measured values and the deviation is determined
in each case. The distribution function, which has the smallest deviation from the measured values,
is recommended as an fitted distribution function.

<p>
In addition for all distributions p-values for various fitting tests are calculated.
The higher a p-value, the harder it is to reject the hypothesis that the measured samples are
based on the respective distribution. For all distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov fit test
and the Chi<sup>2</sup> fit test are performed. While the Kolmogorov-Smirnov fit test evaluates
the maximum deviations between the measured samples and distribution function,
the Chi<sup>2</sup> fit test considers the mean deviations. For the normal distribution,
the Anderson-Darling test, which is a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, is also performed.
