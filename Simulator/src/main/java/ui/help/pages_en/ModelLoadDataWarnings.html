<h1>Error loading external data</h1>

<p>
Using the menu item "External model data" in the model menu, external data (in the form of table cells)
can be defined, which are either manually or automatically loaded as parameters into the model immediately
before a simulation is started. If errors occur during this loading process, either because the data source
is not available or because the loaded values cannot be used for the respective parameters,
they are described in this dialog.
