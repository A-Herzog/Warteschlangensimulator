<h1>Model element: While</h1>

<p>
The While element forwards clients depending on a condition either to the directly following station
(if the condition is fulfilled) or to the next <a href="ModelElementLogicEndWhile.html">EndWhile</a>
station. This allows to implement a graphical flow control similar to classical programming
languages.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the station has no meaning for the simulation.
The next station for forwarding the clients to is selected by the given condition.
