<h1>Model element: Parking lot</h1>

<p>
If there is no station requesting a transporter after it has reached its
destination station the transporter will stay at the destination station. 
If the transporter is requested later it will may have to move a far distance
to the requsting origin station. A parking lot station can requst a transporter
just like a origin station. But the transporter will not be loaded at a parking lot;
it will just stay there and wait. The advantage of using parking lots is that
a parking lot can be much closer to a origin station. So if a transporter
already waiting at a parking lot is requested by an origin station the
travel distance may be much shorter.

The name of the parking lot element has no further meaning.
The <b>Transporter type</b> drop down box allows to define which
type of transporters is to be attracted by the parking lot station.
The <b>Parking lot capacity</b> defined the maximum number of
transporters which can wait at the station. The
<b>Priority for requesting free transporters</b> should always be
smaller than the priority for requesting free transporters of
origin stations. Otherwise free transporters will head to parking
lots instead of moving to origin stations where they are needed
for transporting.
