<h1>Record simulation to log file</h1>

<p>
The function for recording a simulation makes it possible to record all events processed during the
simulation in a log file. In this way, the behavior of the simulator or the movement of individual
clients through by the system can be precisely understood.
</p>

<p>
Since, depending on the complexity of the model and the selected file format, at least 1 KB of data
per client is generated during the recording, it is recommended to limit the number of client to be
simulated to a as small as possible value.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
The program function "<a href="LogAnalyzer.html">Log file analysis</a>"
allows to analyze a recorded simulation run graphically.
