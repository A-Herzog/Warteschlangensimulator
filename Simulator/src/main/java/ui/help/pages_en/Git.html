<h1>Git configurations</h1>

<p>
If model files, statistics data, parameter series or optimizer settings are stored in a directory via the graphical user interface
of the simulator, they can be transferred directly to a Git repository using the simulator if the directory represents a Git repository.
</p>

<p>
The "Git Configurations" dialog can be used to specify various folders that are Git repositories.
In addition, a server address can be specified for each folder.
If files are stored in this folder, they are transferred to both the local repository and the repository located on the server.
After the configuration of the corresponding folders, no further interactions are necessary for this in the following;
the processing takes place automatically and in the background.
In addition, it can be set per directory whether a data synchronization from the server to the local directory should take place when the simulator program is started,
so that the simulator will find all files in the newest revisions in the local directory in the following.
</p>

<h3>Pull</h3>
<p>
This function performs a data synchronization from the server to the local directory.
It can be set per Git directory that such a pull is done automatically at program start.
</p>

<h3>Push</h3>
<p>
This function transfers data from the local Git directory to the server.
New or modified files must first be added to the local Git system via a commit.
Then they can be transferred to the server via push.
If Git storage for simulator files is activated for a directory, the creation of a commit with subsequent push for saved files takes place automatically.
</p>
<p>
If commits have been created using external programs, but these have not yet been transferred to the server via push,
or if the server was not available during the last commit &amp; push call in the simulator,
this transfer can started by an explicit call of the push function.
</p>

<h3>Clone</h3>
<p>
When setting up a local Git repository, it is recommended to start with data from a remote repository on a server.
Cloning a remote repository transfers all data from a Git server to a local directory.
</p>

<h3>Accessing a server</h3>
<p>
The URL to access a Git server should most likely be of the form <tt>ssh://git@servername:portnumber/path</tt>, where <tt>:portnumber</tt> is optional.
Authentication to the server is done using either a user name and password or an SSH key.
An SSH key consists of a public portion (stored on the server) and a private portion.
To connect to the server, the private key must be specified in the simulator.
The private key has to start with the line:<br>
 <tt>-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</tt>
<br>It can be created using the <tt>ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM</tt> command.
