<h1>Model properties dialog</h1>

<p><i>
The model properties dialog can be accessed via the menu item File|Model properties.
</i></p>

<p>
In contrast to the program settings, the model properties are stored with the respective model.
The model properties are used to describe the model more closely and to configure the course of the simulation.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/brick_edit.png">&nbsp; Model description</h2>

<h3>Name of the model</h3>
<p>
The name given in this free text field is stored with the model and can be used (similar to the filename)
as a short description of the model.
</p>

<h3>Author of the model</h3>
<p>
The name given in this free text field is stored with the model and can be used for documenting who has
created the model.
</p>

<h3>Model description</h3>
<p>
The description of the model contained in this free-text field is stored with the model and allows to store
a description or explanation of the model directly in the model file.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/action_go.gif">&nbsp; Simulation</h2>

<h3>Use number of client arrivals as criterion for the end of the simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the <b>Number of arrivals to be simulated</b>
will be used as a criterion for terminating the simulation.
</p> 

<h3>Number of arrivals to be simulated</h3>
<p>
if the number of arrivals is reached and if the option
<b>Use number of client arrivals as criterion for the end of the simulation</b>
is activated, the simulation process will be terminated.
In order to get statistically stable results, a value as large as possible should be entered here.
During the simulation, a simulation process is started on each CPU core, on each of which only
a portion of the arrivals indicated here to be simulated.
</p>

<h3>Warm-up phase</h3>
<p>
Before the counting of the waiting and processing times for the statistics starts, 
a certain number of clients can pass through the system and will not be counted for the statistics.
In this field you can specify the number of clients who are not counted for the statistics
in relation to the total number of clients. This number is not subtracted from the number
of clients to be simulated, but it is preempted to it.
</p>
<p>
The warm-up phase will also be applied if the total number of arrivals to be simulated
is not used as an termination criterion for the simulation.
</p>

<h3>Use condition as a criterion for the end of the simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is active, the condition enter at <b>Condition for end of simulation</b>
will be evaluated during the simulation. If the condition is true, the simulation will
be terminated.
</p>

<h3>Condition for end of simulation</h3>
<p>
If this condition is met and if the option
<B>Use condition as a criterion for the end of the simulation</b>
if activated, the simulation process will be terminated.
</p>

<h3>Stop simulation after a certain time</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulation process will be terminated when the time
specified in the following field has been reached or exceeded.
</p>

<h3>Time at which the simulation ends</h3>
<p>
If this time is reached or exceeded and if the option
<b>Stop simulation after a certain time</b> is activated,
the simulation process will be terminated.
</p>

<h3>Fixed seed value for random number generator</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the random numbers generator is initialized
with the same fixed seed value as set in this field before each simulation
or animation run. This results in the same sequence of random numbers for
each simulation or animation run. For example, in the animation exactly
the same events will occur in exactly the same order. However, the use of a
fixed seed value for the random numbers generator prevents the distribution
of the simulation over multiple CPU cores.
</p>

<h3>Number of repetitions of the entire simulation run</h3>
<p>
This field can be used to repeat the entire simulation run several times.
In the statistics the data of the repetitions are summarized.
</p>

<h3>Hours to be recorded in distributions</h3>
<p>
This field can be used to define a maximum value for recording quantity
distributions. The default value is one hour. This means all
waiting times etc. longer than one hour will be recorded as one hour
in the values distribution. The larger this value is, the more exact
large values can be recorded in the distribution of the values but
also the more memory will be needed for simulation. The recording of
the performance indicators (like mean etc.) will always be exact
independent of the size of the values distribution.
</p>

<h3>Cancel simulation, if a calculation expression cannot be evaluated</h3>

<p>
If a calculation expression can not be evaluated during a running simulation,
the result is usually assumed to be 0. Likewise, a comparison is considered
to be false if one or both sides can not be evaluated. If this option is
activated, the simulation will be aborted with a corresponding error message
instead in such a case.
</p>

<h3>Use time based checks</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, additional time-based, non-event-based checks
of the conditions can be triggered at the condition stations.
This slows down the simulation process considerably, but also makes it possible
to correctly map conditions in which the simulation time is used directly.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/user.png">&nbsp; Clients</h2>

<p>
On this dialog page additional data for the client types used in the model can be entered.
A color can be specified for each client type, which will be used in the diagrams in the simulation
result view for this client type. An initial icon type for the client type to be used while animation
can be defined. And it can be specified how much costs are incurred per waiting, transfer and process
time for the chosen type.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/group.png">&nbsp; Operators</h2>

<p>
This page can you can set up how many operators of which types should be available in the model.
The operators are used at the operating stations to serve the clients. Several operators
(possibly different types) may be necessary to process a client, or several operator stations
can also share certain operator groups.
</p>

<p>
For the case the operators are displayed during animation at the stations an icon for
the operators group can be defined.
</p>

<p>
In addition three cost values can be specified per operators group: You can define how many costs
are generated by the presence of the operators in the group per hour (regardless of whether
the operators are working or not), you can define the additional costs per utilization hour
(for example additional costs for electrical power or technical resources) and the additional
costs for idle time.
</p>

<p>
For each resource failures can be defined. In this case the operators in this resource
are going into a down time after a defined number of served clients or after a certain
available time or a certain busy time or by a distribution defining the distances between
two down times or by an expression defining the distances between two down times.
</p>

<p>
The field <b>Resource priority at a station in case of a tie</b> allows to define in a global
manner how free operators should be routed to the stations if some stations have the same
resource priority. In this case a station can be chosen by random or the client priority
of the there waiting client with the highest client priority can be used as a secondary resource
priority.
</p> 

<p>
If the operators of the chosen resource group are used at multiple process stations additional
a set up time when switching from one to another station can be defined.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/lorry.png">&nbsp; Transporters</h2>

<p>
Transporters are used to carry client from
<a href="ModelElementTransportTransporterSource.html">Transporter start</a>
to <a href="ModelElementTransportSource.html">Transport destination</a>
stations. Transporters behave similar to resources. But in contrast to
resources they have a defined location. This means the transporting times
need not to be defined by distributions by are calculated from the distance
between origin and destination station. (A distance matrix for all origin
and destination stations can be set up per transporter type.) Additionally
loading and unloading times which apply if the transporter was carrying
clients can be defined per transporter type.
</p>

<p>
For the case the transporters are displayed during animation an icon for
each transporter group can be defined.
</p>

<p>
For each transporter group failures can be defined. In this case the transporters in this group
are going into a down time after a defined number of served clients or after a certain
driven distance or a certain busy time or by a distribution defining the distances between
two down times or by an expression defining the distances between two down times.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/time.png">&nbsp; Schedules</h2>

<p>
On the schedules page you can define schedules for the arrivals and for the operator availability.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/text_list_numbers.png">&nbsp; Sequences</h2>

<p>
On the sequences dialog page, sequences which can be assigned to clients by
<a href="ModelElementAssignSequence.html">Assign sequence</a> elements can be
defined. Sequences control the transport destinations used by
<a href="ModelElementTransportSource.html">Transport origin</a> and
<a href="ModelElementTransportTransporterSource.html">Transporter start</a>
elements. In this way, the information to which stations clients should be
transported can be completely controlled on the client side. These stations only
execute the plans. You do not need to define the destination stations for the
individual client types at the stations. 
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/font.png">&nbsp; Initial variablen values</h2>

<p>
On this dialog page variables and their values can be defined, which should
be available already from the beginning of the simulation. In this way, e.g.
constants that are used in different places in calculation expressions can
be defined.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/chart_curve_add.png">&nbsp; Run time statistics</h2>

<p>
On this page expressions can be defined, which should be continuously evaluated and recorded during the simulation.
In this way, the course of certain quantities over the simulation time can be recorded.
</p>

<p>
Using this feature slows down the simulation process. In addition, if the step size is chosen too small,
considerable amounts of data can arise.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/chart_curve.png">&nbsp; Output analysis</h2>

<h3>Record autocorrelation of the waiting times</h3>

<p>
If this option is selected, the autocorrelation of the waiting times
of the clients will be recorded during the simulation and then will
be available in the statistics. Selecting a sensible value for
the  maximum clients distance for the autocorrelation recording
is very important. The larger this value is, the more the simulation
will slows down. But if the selected value is smaller than the actual
autocorrelation distance of the clients, then this is no longer detected correctly.
</p>

<p>
Using this feature slows down the simulation process. 
In particular, the detection of the autocorrelation for all waiting times
(i.e. for each clients group and for each station individual) and the
selection of a large maximum autocorrelation values to be detected
results in significant slowing of the simulation.
</p>

<h3>Batch sizes for confidence interval calculations</h3>

<p>
Confidence intervals can only be calculated if the individual measurements are
independent of each other. For the waiting times of successive clients, this is
usually not the case. Therefore, instead of using the times of individual clients,
the average values over so-called batches are considered. The batches should be
chosen large enough that for clients who are in two consecutive batches, the
autocorrelation of their waiting times is below a selected threshold (e.g., 5%).
</p>

<p>
This batch size for calculating confidence intervals for waiting, transfer and
process times can be set in this field.
Alternatively the batch size can also be determined automatically
via the <a href="FindBatchSize.html">Determine statistics batch size</a>
function in dependence of a selected threshold value.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/Vertex.png">&nbsp; Path recording</h2>

<p>
The additional recording options offered on this dialog page make it easier
to follow the paths taken by clients through the system. On the basis of these
recordings, <a href="Sankey.html">Sankey diagrams</a> can be created later to
visualize this data. However, the simulation process is also slowed down by
these additional recordings.
</p>

<h3>Count station transitions</h3>

<p>
This option activates the counting of how often a client has
changed from a certain station to another in the simulation.
If there are stations in the model where several lines of clients
converge or separate, it is not possible to fully understand how
the lines of clients move through the system, but the relationship
between the individual stations becomes clear.
</p>

<h3>Record client paths</h3>

<p>
If this option is activated, all paths of the clients are recorded.
The statistics show which paths were chosen by how many clients.
In this way, relationships can be tracked even across stations where
different client lines converge or separate. However, recording the
paths of clients leads to a greater slowdown in the simulation,
especially in the case of more complex models, so that this option
should only be activated if the information thus obtained is
of interest for the investigation.
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/computer.png">&nbsp; Simulation system</h2>

<p>
This page shows whether the simulation model can be parallelized across all available CPU cores or,
if not, which model properties prevent this.
