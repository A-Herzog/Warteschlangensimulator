<h1>Model element: Multi condition</h1>

<p>
When a multi condition element is passed, a client ist stopped until for an outgouing edge the
corresponding condition is met. The client is send in the direction where the condition is fulfilled.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the multi condition element has no further meaning.
If clients are in the queue, the system checks whether the conditions are fulfilled.
If yes, the next client is released in the direction of the fulfilled condition. After a (simulation time) millisecond the next check
is performed and, if necessary, the next client is released.
If the condition contains values that can change independently of events (e.g. the simulated time),
it may is necessary, to activate the option "Do additional time-based condition checks". In this case,
the value of the condition is additionally checked in certain time intervals. How long these intervals
are can be configured in the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">Model properties</a> dialog.
Additional time-based checks significantly slow down the simulation and should only be activated
if this is for the condition necessary.
