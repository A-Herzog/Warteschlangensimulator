<h1>Model element: Release resource</h1>

<p>
In a release resource element resources, that have von previously seized by a
<a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resource</a> element, are released again.
</p>

<p>
The three elements <a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resource</a>, <a href="ModelElementDelay.html">Delay</a> and
<b>release resource</b> in this order therefore work together similar to a
<a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the release resource element has no further meaning. But it is necessary to specify
which <a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resources</a> should work together with this element.
In addition, a time span can be specified between the arrival of a client at the station and
the release of the resources. If such a time period has been defined, the client will already have
left the release element when the relevant resources are actually released.
</p>

<h2>Load client types</h2>

<p>
If a large number of client types with different settings is to be used at a station, this function can be used
to load several client type settings from a table. Each table line contains the data for one client type.
</p>

<p>
The first column specifies the name of the client type, the second the definition of the corresponding times.
Thereby the times can be defined either by a calculation expression or by the definition of a
distribution. The format of the distributions is documented in the pdf document
"Distribution XML reference for Warteschlangensimulator".
