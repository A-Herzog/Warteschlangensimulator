<h1>Model element: Release resource</h1>

<p>
In a release resource element resources, that have von previously seized by a
<a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resource</a> element, are released again.
</p>

<p>
The three elements <a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resource</a>, <a href="ModelElementDelay.html">Delay</a> and
<b>release resource</b> in this order therefore work together similar to a
<a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the release resource element has no further meaning. But it is necessary to specify
which <a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resources</a> should work together with this element.
In addition, a time span can be specified between the arrival of a client at the station and
the release of the resources. If such a time period has been defined, the client will already have
left the release element when the relevant resources are actually released.
