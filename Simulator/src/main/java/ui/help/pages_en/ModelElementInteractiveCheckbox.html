<h1>Model element: Checkbox</h1>

<p>
"Checkbox" elements are not connected to the regular flow of clients.
They can only be used during animation for adjusting the value of
variables.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the "Checkbox" element has no further meaning for the simulation.
In each "Checkbox" element the name of the variable to which values are to
be assigned has to be specified. Additionally the value which should be
applied when activating and unactivating the checkbox during the animation
have to be specified.
