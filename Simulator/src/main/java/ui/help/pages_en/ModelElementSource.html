<h1>Model element: Source</h1>

<p>
The client source represents the starting point of the movement of a client through the system.
A simulation model can consist of one or more source elements.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The <b>name</b> of the source element also defines the names of the clients who originate from it.
The dialog consists of a number of tabs which allow to setup the different properties of the client source:
</p>

<h3>Inter-arrival time</h3>

<p>
With respect to the inter-arrival times, it is possible to determine whether these
should be determined according to a <b>distribution</b>, according to an <b>expression</b>,
on a <b>schedule</b> or by a <b>release condition</b>, a <b>thresholdvalue</b> or by
one or multiple <b>signals</b>.
</p>

<h3>Batch size</h3>

<p>
A batch size larger than 1 can be used to specify that, per arrival, not a single client,
but several clients should arrive at the same time. It is possible to set up the same number
of clients per arrival (fixed batch size) or a distribution of the rates according to which
the respective sizes of the arrival batches are to be determined.
</p>

<h3>Number of arrivals</h3>

<p>
In the general case, a source element generates constantly arrivals according to the
inter-arrival time distribution until the total number of clients in the simulation has been reached
or the simulation has been terminated by an expression. But it can also be defined that the
source element stops generating clients after a specified number of clients.
Alternatively, a maximum number of clients to be generated can be specified.
If no batch arrivals are used, the number of arrival events equals the
number of clients. For batch arrivals, more clients will arrive than there are arrival events.
</p> 

<h3>Starting time</h3>

<p>
In the default case the source elements starts generating arrivals immediately after
starting the simulation. By defining some other start time the client generation
(e.g. the first inter-arrival time before the first client arrival) will start at a later
point of time.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of client variables</h3>

<p>
On this tab client variable assignment to variables like <tt>ClientData(nr)</tt> can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of texts</h3>

<p>
On this tab client text assignments like key:=value can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
