<h1>Data privacy settings</h1>

<p>
The data privacy settings dialog is accessible via the menu item of the same name in the help menu.
The data privacy settings dialog offers collected privacy settings that are also accessible via the
<a href="Setup.html">Settings dialog</a>.
</p>

<p>
The settings offered in this dialog distinguish between two areas:
</p>

<h3>Local settings</h3>

<p>
This section contains settings related to the behavior of the program with respect to the handling of model files.
It is possible to define which data are stored in model files and how model files should be handled in the simulator.
</p>

<h3>Internet</h3>

<p>
The settings in this section can be used to specify whether and in what way the simulator is allowed to access the Internet.
Apart from actions explicitly triggered by the user (clicking links), the simulator only accesses the Internet for searching
and downloading updates.
