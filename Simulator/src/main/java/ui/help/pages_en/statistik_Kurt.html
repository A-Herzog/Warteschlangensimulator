<h1>Excess kurtosis</h1>

<p>
The excess kurtosis is a measure of the tailedness of a data series.
A excess kurtosis of 0 means that the probability distribution or the data series is as peaked as the density of the normal distribution.
Data series with a excess kurtosis smaller/greater than 0 are less/more tailedness than the normal distribution.
</p>

<p>
Formally, skewness is the fourth moment of a probability distribution
normalized to the <a href="statistik_standardabweichung.html">standard deviation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The normal distribution has a excess kurtosis of 0. The uniform distribution has a skewness of -1.2,
the logistic distribution of 1.2 and the hyperbolic secant distribution of 2.
