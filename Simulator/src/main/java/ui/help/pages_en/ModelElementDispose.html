<h1>Model element: Exit</h1>

<p>
Any number of edges can be inserted into an exit element, but no edges run out of this element.
The exit represents the last station of a client in the queue system.
At this station, the client leaves the system, and no further processing is possible thereafter.
All the ways of the client have to end in such an element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the exit element has no further meaning for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
The exit element can be defined as an emergency exit: In this mode, the simulation is aborted
as soon as a client arrives at the station.
