<h1>Model element: Multi source</h1>

<p>
The multi source represents the starting point of the movement of a client through the system.
A simulation model can consist of one or more source or multi source elements.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the multi source element has no meaning for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
Per individual sub source the following settings can be made:
</p>

<p>
Per sub source a <b>name</b> for the client type of the clients to be generated has to be defined.
The dialog consists of a number of tabs which allow to setup the different properties of the client source:
</p>

<h3>Inter-arrival time</h3>

<p>
With respect to the inter-arrival times, it is possible to determine whether these
should be determined according to a <b>distribution</b>, according to an <b>expression</b>,
on a <b>schedule</b>, by a <b>release condition</b>, a <b>threshold value</b>, by
one or multiple <b>signals</b>, by a <b>number of arrivals per interval</b>, by
<b>inter-arrival times per interval</b> or by fixed <b>numerical values</b>
representing arrival times or inter-arrival times.
</p>

<h3>Batch size</h3>

<p>
A batch size larger than 1 can be used to specify that, per arrival, not a single client,
but several clients should arrive at the same time. It is possible to set up the same number
of clients per arrival (fixed batch size) or a distribution of the rates according to which
the respective sizes of the arrival batches are to be determined.
In case of batch arrivals, the inter-arrival times refer to the distances from one batch to the next.
If, for example, batches of each 3 clients arrive with an average inter-arrival time of 2 minutes,
one client arrives every 40 seconds on average.
</p>

<h3>Number of arrivals</h3>

<p>
In the general case, a source element generates constantly arrivals according to the
inter-arrival time distribution until the total number of clients in the simulation has been reached
or the simulation has been terminated by an expression. But it can also be defined that the
source element stops generating clients after a specified number of clients.
Alternatively, a maximum number of clients to be generated can be specified.
If no batch arrivals are used, the number of arrival events equals the
number of clients. For batch arrivals, more clients will arrive than there are arrival events.
</p> 

<h3>Starting time</h3>

<p>
In the default case the source elements starts generating arrivals immediately after
starting the simulation. By defining some other start time the client generation
(e.g. the first inter-arrival time before the first client arrival) will start at a later
point of time.
</p>
<p>
When generating arrivals with specific inter-arrival times (defined by a distribution
or a calculation expression), the first inter-arrival time normally starts at the start time.
The actual first arrival is then at start time+inter-arrival time. The option
<b>First arrival at time 0</b> can be used to set the first arrival to occur
directly at the start time.
</p>

<h3>Additional condition</h3>

<p>
If a condition is defined on this page, arrivals only take place
if this condition is fulfilled at the time at which the arrival is to take place.
The system for determining the arrival times itself works independently of this condition.
Only the actual execution of client arrivals is suppressed if the specified condition is not met.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of client variables</h3>

<p>
On this tab client variable assignment to variables like <tt>ClientData(nr)</tt> can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of texts</h3>

<p>
On this tab client text assignments like key:=value can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Mode for the partial sources</h3>

<p>
It can be set whether all sub-sources should be active at the same time, i.e. the
multiple source acts as if it consists of several individual, independent client sources,
or whether the sub-sources should be used in turn. In the second mode, the inter-arrival times
for the sub-sources has to be consistently defined via probability distributions or calculation expressions.
</p>

<h3>Limit total number of clients to be generated</h3>

<p>
Optionally, a limit for the number of clients to be generated in sum over
all partial sources can be set.
</p>

<h2>Load client types</h2>

<p>
If a large number of client types is to be used in a model, this function can be used
to load several client types from a table. Each table line contains the data for one client type.
</p>

<p>
The first column specifies the name of the client type, the second the definition of the inter-arrival times.
Thereby the inter-arrival times can be defined either by a calculation expression or by the definition of a
distribution. The format of the distributions is documented in the pdf document
"Distribution XML reference for Warteschlangensimulator". These two columns can be followed by any number
of additional columns with the following contents:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>batch=</tt><br>
  Specifies the arrival batch size. Either a positive integer can be specified, or a series of values separated
  by ";" of the form <tt>size=rate</tt> to define different rates for different batch sizes.</li>
  <li><tt>count=</tt><br>
  Indicates the total number of arrival events.</li>
  <li><tt>start=</tt><br>
  Specifies the start of the first inter-arrival time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally a assignment, that can be made at a <a href="ModelElementSourceTable.html">Table source</a>, can be used.
