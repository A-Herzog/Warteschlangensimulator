<h1>Model element: Input (Script)</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, a numerical value is read from a file
and make available in an user-defined Javascript or Java program.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the input element has no further meaning for the simulation.
You need to set up the name of the input file to be read, the intended behavior
at the end of the file and the script to be executed.
The script commands to be executed are defined in <b>Javascript</b> or in <b>Java</b>.
Next to the default Javascript or Java commands some 
<a href="JS.html">additional Javascript commands</a> or
<a href="Java.html">additional Java commands</a> 
are available for accessing the simulation data.
</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>
The script based variable assignment allows maximum flexibility, but takes a comparatively long
computing time. A faster option for assigning variables is using the
<a href="ModelElementInput.html">Input</a> element.
