<h1>Template for new models</h1>

<p>
When the "New" menu item in the ""File" menu is invoked, a new, empty model with internally predefined initial settings is normally created.
However, an external file can also be stored from which a new model is derived when the menu function is invoked.
This file has to be named <b>Normal.xml</b>b> and has to be located either in the settings directory or in the program directory of the simulator.
