<h1>Model element: Seize resource</h1>

<p>
In order for a client to be able to pass this element, appropriate resources have to be available,
which are seized by the movement of the client through the element but are not released again.
</p>

<p>
The resources have to be released later by a <a href="ModelElementRelease.html">Release resource</a> element.
</p>

<p>
The three elements <a href="ModelElementSeize.html">Seize resource</a>, <a href="ModelElementDelay.html">Delay</a> and
<b>release resource</b> in this order therefore work together similar to a
<a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The seize resource element needs a name because the <a href="ModelElementRelease.html">Release resource</a> elements
for this resources need to refer to the element.
</p>

<p>
In order to forward a client may several operators from several groups are required.
The client is only relased if all the necessary operators are available at the same
time and all can be seized simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
The resource priority can be used to define the priority of this element when a resource that
is necessary at this station becomes free. Larger values mean a higher priority or a higher probability
that this element receives the corresponding resources if there are several stations that need the same resource.
