<h1>Quantiles</h1>

<p>
The quantiles provide information on how the concrete values of a series of measurements
are distributed over the value range and thus represent a supplement to the
<a href="statistik_standardabweichung.html">standard deviation</a> but also to the
<a href="statistik_mittelwert.html value.html">average value</a>.
</p>
<p>
Quantiles indicate how large a proportion of the measured values is that is
less than or equal to a certain value. For example, if the 75% quantile of
the waiting times is 100 seconds, this means that 75% of the clients had to
wait for a maximum time of 100 seconds.
</p>

<h3>Median</h3>
<p>
In connection with the <a href="statistik_mittelwert.html">average value</a>,
the median is also often mentioned. While the average value has the advantage
that it can be easily calculated and is required in many other formulas for
calculating statistical key indicators, it has the disadvantage that it is
susceptible to outliers. If a single value in the measurement series is
increased massively, this has a major impact on the average value - although
the rest of the measurement series has not changed at all except for the
single outlier. The median, however, indicates "the value in the middle"
of a measurement series. If the value of a single outlier is changed,
this has no effect on the median.
</p>
<p>
Mathematically, the median is just the 50% quantile, i.e. the measured value
for which half of the measured values are less than or equal to this value
(and consequently the other 50% of the measured values are greater than this value).
