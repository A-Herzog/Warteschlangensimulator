<h1>Model element: Simulation time</h1>

<p>
The simulation time element allows to display the current simulation time
(or any other seconds-based value) in form of an analogue clock during animation.
For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.

The name of the simulation time element has no further meaning.
For the expression to be displayed in the clock any expression the simulation can calculate can be used.
