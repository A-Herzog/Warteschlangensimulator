<h1>Model element: Sensor</h1>

<p>
A sensor element triggers a signal just like a <a href="ModelElementSignal.html">Signal</a> element.
But in constrast to the signal element the signal ist not triggered on a client arrival
but when a threshold value at a connected <a href="ModelElementTank.html">Tank</a> element
is exceeded or underflowed.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the sensor element is also the name of the signal that is triggered when the condition is matched.
As condition, either the exceeding or falling below a certain threshold value in a tank can be used.
