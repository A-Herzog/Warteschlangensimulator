By using a Leave section element, an <a href="ModelElementSectionStart.html">Enter section</a> element
can be told that a client has left the model segment under consideration.

The name of the Leave section element has no further meaning for the simulation.
The name of the <a href="ModelElementSectionStart.html">Enter section</a> station
from which the client should be discharged while passing through this element has
to be specified. If the client has not passed the associated
<a href="ModelElementSectionStart.html">Enter section</a> element before,
no processing will occur.
