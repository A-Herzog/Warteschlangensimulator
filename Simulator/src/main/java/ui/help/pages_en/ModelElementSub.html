<h1>Model element: Sub model</h1>

<p>
This element can contain a complete sub model, which is only visible as a single element in the main model.
In this way, partial components can be encapsulated and the model can be kept visually clear.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the sub model and the description for the sub model have
no further meaning for the simulation.
The number of input and output edges into and out of the sub model can
be defined. The incoming and outgoing edges are visible in the sub model
as connecting elements to the superordinate model.
