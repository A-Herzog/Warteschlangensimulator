<h1>Settings dialog</h1>

<p><i>
The settings dialog can be accessed via the File|Settings menu item.
</i></p>

<p>
In the settings dialog, the basic configuration of the simulator can be performed.
The dialog consists of the following tabs:
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/application_go.png">&nbsp; User interface</h2>

<h3>Program language</h3>
<p>
In the field can be select whether the program interface should be displayed in English or in German.
</p>
<p>
(If German is selected as the system language, the default value is "German", otherwise it is "English".)
</p>

<h3>Spell checking</h3>
<p>
Warteschlangensimulator comes with English and German spell checking dictionaries.
This allows to check the input in multiline text fields (model descriptions, text elements, etc.)
In the configuration dialog for the spell checker, individual dictionaries can be activated or deactivated
and the list of words added by the user can be edited.
</p>
<p>
The spell checker can use dictionaries in xpi and oxt format.
The xpi files are Firefox extensions, the oxt files are OpenOffice/LibreOffice extensions.
Additional dictionaries can therefore be obtained from the following addresses:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/language-tools/">Mozilla Language Tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://extensions.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice Extensions</a></li>
</ul> 
<p>
Integration of the additional dictionaries is possible directly via the spell check dialog.
</p> 

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>
In Java (depending on the used operating system) different themes for styling the graphical
program interface are available. This field can be used to select the theme to be used.
</p>
<p>
(The default is "System default", i.e. styling the program in the form intended for native programs.)
</p>

<h3>Menu in window title</h3>
<p>
In one of the flat themes is selected and if the simulator is running under Windows 10, the main menu
can be integrated directly into the title bar. If this option is activated, this integration takes place
and there is accordingly an additional line of space available for the model in the program window.
If the simulator is run under an operating system other than Windows 10 or if none of the flat themes
is selected, this option has no meaning.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Font size for user-interface</h3>
<p>
From this combo box the font sizes (and hence the dialog window sizes)
can be configured for an optimal readability.
Changing the font sizes will take effect after a restart of the program.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "Normal".)
</p>

<h3>Font size for scripting editor fields</h3>
<p>
In this combo box, the font size (in points) to be used in the input fields
for Javascript and Java code can be specified. This setting is independent
of the general font size for the user-interface.
</p>
<p>
(The default font size is 13 points.)
</p>

<h3>Use high contrasts</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the elements on the surface are displayed with a consistently high contrast.
For this, individual colors for the stations as well as color gradients are deactivated.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Save model automatically</h3>
<p>
This combo box allows to set whether the model is to be automatically saved
never, before each start of a simulation or an animation or after each change to the model.
</p>
<p>
(By default automatic saving is disabled.)
</p>

<h3>Offer recently used files for loading</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated in the file menu
in the submenu "Recently used" the previous
loaded or saved models are offered for loading.
</p>
<p>
(By default offering the recently used files for loading is enabled.)
</p>

<h3>Restore last edited model at next program start</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the last model in the editor before the program quits is automatically
saved internally and loaded back into the editor the next time the program is started. An explicit
saving of the model as a file is not necessary for this function.
</p>
<p>
(By default automatic restore is disabled.)
</p>

<h3>Window size on program start</h3>
<p>
In this selection field, you can set how the program window should look at the start of the simulator.
In addition to "Default window size" and "Full screen", the option "Restore last window size" provides
the option to save the window size at the end of the program and restore it at the next startup.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "Default window size".)
</p>

<h3>Templates panel on program start</h3>
<p>
This selection field can be used to specify whether the element templates panel should be displayed or hidden
at the left edge of the model editor window at the start of the program. The panel can be turned on or off at
any time using the "Element" button on the left vertical toolbar.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "Hide".)
</p>

<h3>Load model on program start</h3>
<p>
When you start the program, an example model can be loaded directly instead of an empty drawing surface.
In this selection field, you can set whether such an example model is to be loaded.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "Empty model".)
</p>

<h3>Show hints on drawing surface</h3>
<p>
If the drawing surface is empty, hints for the usage of the vertical
toolbar and for receiving help can be displayed.
</p>
<p>
(By default hints will only by shown right after program start on the drawing surface.)
</p>

<h3>Display semi-transparent information on the drawing surface</h3>
<p>
If the mouse wheel is used on the drawing surface or elements on the drawing surface
are moved with the mouse, a semi-transparent information is displayed
with which shift keys which further actions can be triggered.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Show notification when simulation is done</h3>
<p>
This option allows to define if a system notification is to be displayed
when a simulation, a parameter series simulation or an optimization is completed.
</p>
<p>
(By default notification will only be displayed when the simulation takes a longer time.)
</p>

<h3>Show advises in dialogs</h3>
<p>
This button opens a dialog to configure if additional information panels are to be
displayed in the top area of some dialogs and if a welcome page is to be displayed
on program start.
</p>
<p>
(By default all information panels will be displayed but the welcome page will not be used.)
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/computer.png">&nbsp; Performance</h2>

<h3>Background processing</h3>
<p>
From this combo box one can choose how much (pre-) processing the simulator should already
perform in the background for a model. The more steps there are performed in the background
during the work in the model editor, the less time is needed later on the simulation but
also the more computer power is necessary.
</p>
<p>
(The default value for this option is "Simulate model in the background if appropriate".)
</p>

<h3>Use animation in user-interface</h3>
<p>
If this option is enabled, slide-in and slide-out animations are displayed when
activating and deactivating the element template bar and the model navigator.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Use multiple CPU cores for simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulation is distributed over all available CPU cores.
As a result, the required computing time drops significantly, but at the same time the memory requirement increases.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Split repeated simulations if reasonable</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated and additionally the multi-core simulation is activated as well,
then the set number of repetitions is possibly increased by the simulator. If a model is to be
simulated several times, the individual repetitions are distributed to the available CPU cores.
If the configured number of repetitions is smaller than the number of available CPU cores, some
cores would not be used at all. To make the best use of the available CPU power, if this option
is enabled, the number of repetitions is doubled and at the same time the number of client
arrivals per repetition is halved until all CPU cores are used. This results in better confidence
intervals than would actually have been expected by the user settings for the number of
repetitions of the simulation. Therefore, this option is disabled by default.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Use multiple CPU cores for animation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the animation is distributed over multiple CPU cores.
Simulation and displaying the animation progress is done by two different threads.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>High priority for simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulation is performed with a higher priority with respect to the available computing power.
This can slightly accelerate the simulation, but can also lead to other applications running in parallel being delayed
during the simulation.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>NUMA-aware simulation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulator uses a separate, independent data model for each simulation thread.
This increases the memory consumption. But on the other side it allows to distribute the data in the memory in
such a way that on systems where not all memory areas can be accessed by all CPU cores at the same speed
(NUMA systems), the data can accessed as efficiently as possible.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Preferred Javascript engine</h3>
<p>
There are three engines available for executing Javascript code in the simulator: One engine
is provided by the Java runtime environment. This engine is faster but may will not be
available in further Java versions. The second engine is the Mozilla Rhino engine with is
integrated into the simulator. This engine is slower but is always available. When using
GraalVM also the GraalJS engine is available. If "Select automatically" is selected,
the fastest available engine will be used.
</p>
<p>
(As default "Select automatically" is selected.)
</p>
<p>
The name of the currently active engine can be received via the global
Javascript variable <tt>JS_ENGINE_NAME</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Cancel simulation on script error</h3>
<p>
Shall the simulation or animation be aborted if the execution of a script
at a station leads to an error?
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Maximum javascript code runtime</h3>
<p>
This field can be used to set the maximum time user-defined Javascript code
for filtering statistical results and during a simulation is allowed to run
before it is aborted to avoid blocking the system. The setting applies only
to Javascript code; Java code in the same places cannot be timed out.
</p>
<p>
(The default value for this property is 2.)
</p>

<h3>Run simulations on remote server</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated and if correct access information for a simulation server
are set up, the simulator will try to run each simulation on this server.
If the server is not accessible, the simulation is run local. Also the animation is
always executed locally.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<!--
<h3>Path to Java Development Kit (JDK) / Java compiler</h3>
<p>
For stations which execute user defined Java code the Warteschlangensimulator needs to
be able to run the Java compiler "javac". In this input field the path to the
Java Development Kit (JDK) installation, from which the Java compiler is to be used,
can be specified.
</p>
-->



<h2><img src="../images/film_go.png">&nbsp; Animation</h2>

<h3>Warm-up phase at animation</h3>
<p>
During the warm-up phase no statistics are recorded. If the model is not simulated,
but visualized as an animation, statistical visualization elements
(diagrams, numeric values, bar plot visualizations) will not display any meaningful values
if these statistics (for example, the average number of clients at an process station) are to be displayed.
Therefore, it is useful to skip the warm-up phase or to previously simulate the warm-up phase without
animation output.
</p>
<p>
(The default value for this option is: Always skip if statistics visualizations are active.)
</p>

<h3>Show runtime data for the stations</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, below the station boxes additional data about how many clients
have passed the station and how many clients are currently in the corresponding station
are displayed during the animation.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Show logging information in single step mode</h3>
<p>
If the animation is paused and now is executed in single step mode, if this option is active
the events just executed will be displayed in the program window's status line.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Start animation in single step mode</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the animation is paused immediately after the start,
so that it can be executed in single step mode.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Pause animation when finish</h3>
<p>
If an animation of a model is executed continuously (i.e. not in single step mode), the simulator
automatically switches to the statistics view after the execution of the last event. If this option
is activated, on the other hand, the simulator first switches back to single step mode so that the
model data can be viewed for a last time before the next step then triggers the switch to the statistics view.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Show resources and transporters in animation</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, not only clients but also resources
at stations and transporter are displayed during the animation.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Slow down animation to better reflect the change of analog values</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the animation is not running at maximum speed
and the model contains time continuous values values, the animation is slowed down
to better reflect the changing of this values. (This has no influence on the
statistics collection in the simulation.)
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/sum.png">&nbsp; Statistics</h2>

<h3>Show quantiles</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% quantiles
are displayed on the statistics pages in addition to the usual statistics
parameters.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Show Erlang C comparison</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, a statistics page is displayed on which the
results of the simulation are compared with those of an Erlang C model
derived from the simulation model.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Show remarks about statistic results</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, remarks are displayed in the statistics view
if individual performance indicators show conspicuous values
(e.g. long waiting times for individual client types, etc.).
This allows to identify bottlenecks or errors in the model more quickly.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Always expand the statistics tree completely</h3>
<p>
In the default case, for reasons of clarity, some rarely used
categories are first displayed collapsed in the statistics tree
after a simulation. If this option is activated, however, all
categories are always expanded immediately.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Decimal digits for numerical values</h3>
<p>
This field can be used to define how many decimal digits
should be used for normal numerical values in texts and
tables in the statistics viewer. Possible values are between
1 and 9, but some statistics output has a fixed number of
decimal digits greater than 1, so that more than one decimal
digit is always output here. However, if the value set here
is larger than this value, this value is taken into account.
</p>
<p>
(The default value for this option is 1.)
</p> 

<h3>Decimal digits for percentage values</h3>
<p>
This field can be used to define how many decimal digits
should be used for percentage values in texts and
tables in the statistics viewer. Possible values are between
1 and 9, but some statistics output has a fixed number of
decimal digits greater than 1, so that more than one decimal
digit is always output here. However, if the value set here
is larger than this value, this value is taken into account.
</p>
<p>
(The default value for this option is 1.)
</p>

<h3>Showing quantil values</h3>
<p>
In the default case, quantils for the levels 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 99% are shown.
However, by entering probabilities or percentage values separated by semicolons in this field,
one can define own levels for which quantil are to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
(As the default this field is empty, i.e. quantil levels 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% will be shown.)
</p>

<h3>Confidence levels for batch means confidence intervals</h3>
<p>
If the recording of confidence data on the basis of the batch means method is carried out,
confidence intervals for waiting, transfer, service and residence times of the clients are
available after the simulation. In the default case, confidence intervals for the confidence
levels 90%, 95% and 99% are shown. However, by entering probabilities or percentage values
separated by semicolons in this field, one can define own confidence levels for which
confidence intervals are to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
(As the default this field is empty, i.e. confidence intervals for the levels 90%, 95% and 99% will be shown.)
</p>

<h3>Open results in external applications</h3>
<p>
In this section, you can set which external programs should be offered
for directly transferring data from the text and table statistics viewers.
</p>
<p>
(By default Word and Excel are selected.)
</p>

<h3>Incomplete statistics</h3>
<p>
The two selection boxes in this section allow to define how the simulator should behave
if an animation or a simulation is canceled prematurely. The statistical data collected
up to this point may not yet provide a complete overview of the model, but may still
be useful. It can be defined whether the incomplete data should be discarded or whether
they should be displayed as after a successful completion.
</p>
<p>
(By default, incomplete statistical data is discarded after an animation is canceled,
and after a simulation is canceled, the user is asked if the data should be displayed.)
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/folder_wrench.png">&nbsp; File formats</h2>

<h3>Default author name for new models</h3>
<p>
The name specified in this input field is used as the author name when
creating new models and is registered when running as a simulation as
the simulation user name. The author name can be changed for individual
models via the model properties. The name entered in this field only
represents the default value.
</p>

<h3>Default author e-mail address for new models</h3>
<p>
The e-mail address specified in this input field is used as the author e-mail address when
creating new models. The author e-mail address can be changed for individual
models via the model properties. The e-mail address entered in this field only
represents the default value.
</p>

<h3>Default file formats when saving</h3>
<p>
In these selection fields it can be determined which file format
is to be displayed initially selected in the "Save as" dialogs
for the respective data types.
</p>
<p>
(Default values: "xml" for models and statistics and "zip-compressed xml"
for parameter series and optimiser settings.)
</p>

<h3>Use backup files for models</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, when saving a model file
without entering a new file name, a backup file of the
previous file is created with the file name extension <tt>bak</tt>.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>User-defined row identifier</h3>
<p>
When accessing an Excel table via DDE the simulator uses an identifier for
selecting a row. For English Excel versions this a "R" (for row). The
simulator selects the identifier letter depending on the program language.
If the program language of the simulator and of Excel differ, it is may be
needed to explicitly define an identifier.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option is an empty field.)
</p>

<h3>User-defined column identifier</h3>
<p>
When accessing an Excel table via DDE the simulator uses an identifier for
selecting a column. For English Excel versions this a "C" (for column). The
simulator selects the identifier letter depending on the program language.
If the program language of the simulator and of Excel differ, it is may be
needed to explicitly define an identifier.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option is an empty field.)
</p>

<h3>Resolution when saving images</h3>
<p>
In this field can be specified which resolution should be used in pixels
both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction when storing graphics
from the statistics results as pixel graphics.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: 2000 x 2000 pixel.)
</p>
 
<h3>Saving images during animation</h3>
<p>
If images are saved during the animation by clicking the corresponding toolbar button,
they are stored in the directory defined in this field without any further user interaction.
This allows to keep the interruption of the animation as short as possible.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option is to use the home directory.)
</p>

<h3>Show simulation time in recorded animation</h3>
<p>
If this function is activated, the current simulation time is displayed at the bottom left
in the animations recorded as videos. When an animation is executed in the simulator,
the simulation time is displayed in the status bar, but the status bar is not part of the recorded video.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/lock.png">&nbsp; Security</h2>

<h3>Models containing potentially critical stations</h3>
<p>
From this dropdown box one can select the program behavior when trying to load a
model containing stations which can have influences on the system (this are stations
with script execution and with file or database output). The available options are
to always allow loading, to always deny loading or to ask the user.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "ask user".)
</p>

<h3>Apply restrictions on</h3>
<p>
From this dropdown box one can select if the restrictions selected in
"Models containing potentially critical stations" apply to all model files
to be loaded or only to model files from the Internet.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "Model files from Internet".)
</p>

<h3>Sign models containing scripts</h3>
<p>
If this option is enabled, models that contain critical stations such as scripts will be signed when saving,
so that no security question has to be asked when loading these models on the same computer.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Allow scripts to execute external programs</h3>
<p>
If this option is enabled, external programs can be called from scripts and the respective return value can be further used in the script.
If scripts can call external programs, then in principle arbitrary changes to the computer are possible.
This means that opening and executing models represents a security risk.
It is therefore recommended to activate this option only if absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>
(This option is disabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>When clicking on links</h3>
<p>
If a link is clicked in the simulator, it is passed to the default browser after a showing
a confirmation dialog. This setting can be used to completely prohibit calling a browser.
</p>
<p>
(Default value for this option: "ask user".)
</p>



<h2><img src="../images/action_refresh.gif">&nbsp; Updates</h2>
 
<h3>Check installed Java version and warn if outdated and insecure</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulator checks whether the currently installed and used
Java version was still up to date when the simulator was delivered and, if necessary, issued a safety warning.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h3>Update program automatically</h3>
<p>
If this option is activated, the simulator periodically checks if a new version has been released
and installs it automatically.
This requires the use of the Windows version of the simulator.
</p>
<p>
(If automatic updates are possible, they are active by default.
Otherwise, updates searching and updates notices are active by default.)
</p>
