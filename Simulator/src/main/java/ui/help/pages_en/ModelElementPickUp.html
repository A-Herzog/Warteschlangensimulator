<h1>Model element: Pick up</h1>

<p>
If a client passes this element, a client is also taken from the queue of another element and forwarded
along the new path together with the current client or a temporary or a permanent batch is built with the
current client.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the pick up element has no further meaning. By specifying a
<a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>, a <a href="ModelElementHold.html">condition</a>
or a <a href="ModelElementBarrier.html">barrier</a> element, you can select from which queue the client,
who is to be forwarded together with the current client, should be picked up. You can specify whether
the current client, if there is no client in the queue of the other element, is to be forwarded alone, or
whether the client will wait until another client is present in the other queue. Furthermore, it can be set whether
the combined clients simply leave the station again (at the same time), or whether a temporary batch (which
can be dissolved by the <a href="ModelElementSeparate.html">Dissolve batch</a> element) or whether the route
through the network ends for the clients ends at this point (because the two clients, for example, represent
partial components that are combined into a larger element) and instead a new client object is created and
started from this point.
