<h1>Compare to analytic model dialog</h1>

<p><i>
The Compare to analytic model dialog can be accessed via the menu item Model|Compare to analytic model.
</i></p>

<p>
In this dialog, comparative data according to the Erlang-C and Allen-Cunneen models are output.
If simulation results are available, these are also displayed for comparing analytical models
and simulation results.
To use this function, the model has to be simple enough so that the program can identify a
single, unique source and a single, unique process station.
