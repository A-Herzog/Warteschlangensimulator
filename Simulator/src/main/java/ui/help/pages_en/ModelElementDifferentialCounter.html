<h1>Model element: Difference counter</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, the associated counter is increased or decreased by a certain value.
The minimum value of the counter is 0. If several difference counters have the same name, they share the same
counter object.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the element specifies the counter object, which is to be changed by the element by the specified value
when a client passes the element. The minimum and, at the same time, start value of each counter is 0.
</p>

<p>
Using the two options <b>Condition for counting</b> and <b>Only capture specific client types</b>,
additional conditions can be defined that have to be met for a client passing through the station to be counted.
If no conditions are defined, all clients are counted.
