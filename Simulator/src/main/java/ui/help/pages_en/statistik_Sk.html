<h1>Skewness</h1>

<p>
Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a data series.
A skewness of 0 means that the probability distribution or the data series is symmetrical.
Data series with a skewness smaller than 0 are called <b>left skew</b>,
Data series with a skewness greater than 0 are called <b>right skew</b>.
</p>

<p>
Formally, skewness is the central third moment of a probability distribution
normalized to the <a href="statistik_standardabweichung.html">standard deviation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The symmetric normal distribution has a skewness of 0. The exponential distribution has a skewness of 2,
i.e. it is always right skewed. Likewise, the lognormal distribution and the gamma distribution are always
right skewed. The beta distribution can be left skewed or right skewed.
