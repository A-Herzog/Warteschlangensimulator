<h1>Average values</h1>

<p>
The average value is the most frequently used statistical parameter.
It specifies the average of the values considered and is formed by
summing up all measured values and dividing by the number of values.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
The following 4 values were measured: 3, 5, 7, 5. The sum of these
values is 20, resulting in the mean value of (3+5+7+5)/4=5.
</p>

<h3>Identifier</h3>
<p>
In stochastics, a formal distinction is made between the average value
of a series of measurements and the expected value of the probability
distribution on which the experiment is based. The expected value of
X is designated by E[X]. Since measurement series and distributions
are treated very closely in simulation, the E[X] notation is also used
for the average value. If N denotes the number of clients in the system,
the mean number of clients in the system is denoted by E[N]. In the
mathematical literature, average values are usually represented by a
bar above the corresponding identifier.

<h3>Criticism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The use of statistical parameters means that a large number of measured
  values are compressed to a single quantity. Information is inevitably lost
  during this compression. For example, the mean value does not provide
  information about how the values are distributed. For example, the measurement
  series 0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10 and 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 both have the same average
  value 5, although they are completely different. To also map the distribution
  of the values, the <a href="statistik_standardabweichung.html deviation.html">standard deviation</a>
  is therefore often used.</li>
  <li>The average value is susceptible to individual outliers. The measurement series
  5, 5, 5, 5, 100 has the average value 20, even if all measurements except one have
  delivered the value 5. The average value therefore does not correspond to "the value
  in the middle". If this value in the middle of the measurement series is required,
  the <a href="statistik_quantil.html">50% quantile</a> or, equivalently, the
  <a href="statistik_quantil.html">median</a> should be considered.</li>
</ul>
