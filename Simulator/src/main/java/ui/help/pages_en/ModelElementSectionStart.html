<h1>Model element: Enter section</h1>

<p>
By using sections the residence time of a client in some segment of the model can be measured.
A client passing through this station is immediately forwarded to the next station.
However, leaving the station is not recorded in the station statistics, so from the station
statistics point of view the client is still at this station. Only when the client moves through
an appropriate <a href="ModelElementSectionEnd.html">Leave section</a> element it will be
virtually removed from the station.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
Stations of this type must have a name which allows them to be addressed by
<a href="ModelElementSectionEnd.html">Leave section</a> elements to signal
that the client has now left the section.
