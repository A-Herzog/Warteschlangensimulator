<h1>Model element: Barrier</h1>

<p>
This element is used to stop incoming clients until a signal arrives on which they are released.
Corresponding signals are generated if a clients passes a
<a href="ModelElementSignal.html">Signal</a> element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the barrier element has no further meaning. You have to specify a least one
<a href="ModelElementSignal.html">Signal</a> element that signals the release of clients waiting here.
The number of waiting clients which are released at an incoming signal can be set up as well as
if the release should act on all client type or on only one client type.
Furthermore, a number of clients who are allowed to pass the barrier before the counting begins
can be defined. If a signal arrives while no client is waiting, it is possible to specify whether
this signal should be saved for a client who is then to be released immediately later, or whether
it should be discarded.
</p>

<p>
If multiple signals are specified, it is normally sufficient for one to be triggered in order
to release one or more waiting clients. However, the option
"All configured signals have to be triggered for a release" can be used to configure that
all specified signals have to be triggered for a release to take place.
