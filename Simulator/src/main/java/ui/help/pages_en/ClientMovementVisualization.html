<h1>Visualize paths dialog</h1>

<p>
If the <b>client path recording</b> was activated (see <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">Model properties dialog</a>),
by the corresponding statistics pages the dialog for visualizing the client paths can be opened.
In this dialog, the paths of the customers through the system, sorted according to their frequency,
are visualized directly in the model.
