<h1>Edit transporter paths dialog</h1>

<p>
For each way point can be set on which routes from which origin to which
destination station they are to be visited.
For larger models, this configuration can quickly become expensive.
The edit transporter paths dialog helps to simplify this process.
In this dialog, for each station one or more possible follow-up stations
can be defined. If the dialog is closed by "Ok", the simulator will try
to find paths from each station to each other station on this basis and
configure the way points so that they are visited respectively in the
right order on the right way.
