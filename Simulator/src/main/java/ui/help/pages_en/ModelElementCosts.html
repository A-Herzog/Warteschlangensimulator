<h1>Model element: Costs</h1>

<p>
If a client passes this element, some waiting, transfer and process time costs can be added to the
statistics. In addition, costs due to the station itself can be recorded, too.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the cost element has no further meaning. The defined clients costs are recorded in the clients element
of the client who passes the station. Additionally, costs can be specified which are recorded for the station itself.
</p>

<p>
The optional condition allows an assignment to be made only under certain conditions,
when a client passes the station.
