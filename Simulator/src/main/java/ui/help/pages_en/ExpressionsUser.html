<h1>User-defined functions dialog</h1>

<p>
In this dialog additional functions can be defined, which are available
then in all calculation expressions as regular functions. Within
a user-defined function, all common arithmetic expressions are available.
When defining a user-defined function, it has to be specified how many
parameters it should have. The parameters are passed in round brackets
after the function name, as with a built-in function. Within the
user-defined function the passed values are available in the variables
"Parameter1", "Parameter2" and so on.
