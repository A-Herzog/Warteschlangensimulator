<h1>Model element: Teleport transport source</h1>

<p>
Teleport transports allow to timeless transport a client from a teleport transport source
to a <a href="ModelElementTeleportDestination.html">teleport transport destination</a>.
In contrast to normal transports, this is not about modeling a clients's actual transport
(which may takes a certain amount of time and requires some resources), but to keep the model clear.
If a client enters a teleport transport source, he is immediately transported to the specified
teleport transport destination. Start and end points can be located in different places in the model;
unlike a transport over an edge, no connection line between start and finish is drawn.

<p>
The name of the teleport transport source element has no further meaning for the simulation.
However, the name of a <a href="ModelElementTeleportDestination.html">Teleport transport destination</a>
to which the arriving clients are to be transported has to be specified.
