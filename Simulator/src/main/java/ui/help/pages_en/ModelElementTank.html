<h1>Model element: Tank</h1>

<p>
The element contains a value which can change over the time.
Each tank contains one or more valves. Flows (see <a href="ModelElementTankFlowByClient.html">Flow</a>
and <a href="ModelElementTankFlowBySignal.html">Flow (Signal)</a> elements)
can be connected to the valves.The valves define how much of the content of the tank
can flow per time unit, the flows define how much is to be transported or how long
the flow should be active.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the <a href="ModelElementAnalogValue.html">Analog value</a> elements
the value of a tank can never be negative and always has an upper limit (the capacity of the tank).
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to connect a flow to a valve at all times.
If a flow is connect to a valve, it will be served directly.
If several flows are connect, only one flow will be served at any one time.
Only when the first time flow has been processed, the next is activated.
This means multiple flows will not share the available flow rate of a valve.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the tank element has no further meaning for the simulation.
Next to the capacity, the initial value and the valves with their maximum flow per time unit
one can specify how often the discreet simulation should be informed about the change of
the continuous value.
