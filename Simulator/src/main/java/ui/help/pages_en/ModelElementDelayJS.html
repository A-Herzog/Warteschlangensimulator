<h1>Model element: Delay (Script)</h1>

<p>
When passing a delay element, the clients are delayed for a specific time period which can be determined
 by means of a distribution function or an expression. There will be no further processing on the clients.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the delay element has no further meaning. 
The return value of the script code is used to determine the delay time each time a client arrives. 
</p>

<p>
The script code can contain any Javascript or Java commands as well as some
<a href="JS.html">special Javascript commands</a> or
<a href="Java.html">special Java commands</a> for accessing the simulation system.
As return value (to be output by <tt>Output.print()</tt>) a numerical value
which denotes the delay time in seconds is expected.
</p>

<p>
If clients are to be released via an external script element for further movement through the system before the delay time has elapsed,
it must be activated via the corresponding checkbox that a corresponding list for script access should be provided. The provision of
this list slows down the simulation, even if it is not accessed.
