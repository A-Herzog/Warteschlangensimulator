<h1>Setup heatmap dialog</h1>

<p>
After the completion of a simulation, the station-related performance indicators
can be visualized directly on the drawing surface in the form of a heatmap.
In this dialog, the general appearance of the heatmap, i.e. the colors used
and the size of the colored areas around the station symbols can be set.
