<h1>Model element: Delay</h1>

<p>
When passing a delay element, the clients are delayed for a specific time period which can be determined
 by means of a distribution function or an expression. There will be no further processing on the clients.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the delay element has no further meaning. The distribution or the expression of the delay times can be used
to determine how long the individual clients have to wait while passing the element. A global distribution or expression,
which is always applied when no client-type-specific data are defined, and optionally an individual distribution or expression
can be specified for each client type.
</p>
<p>
If clients are to be released via an external script element for further movement through the system before the delay time has elapsed,
it must be activated via the corresponding checkbox that a corresponding list for script access should be provided. The provision of
this list slows down the simulation, even if it is not accessed.
</p>

<h2>Load client types</h2>

<p>
If a large number of client types with different settings is to be used at a station, this function can be used
to load several client type settings from a table. Each table line contains the data for one client type.
</p>

<p>
The first column specifies the name of the client type, the second the definition of the corresponding times.
Thereby the times can be defined either by a calculation expression or by the definition of a
distribution. The format of the distributions is documented in the pdf document
"Distribution XML reference for Warteschlangensimulator".
