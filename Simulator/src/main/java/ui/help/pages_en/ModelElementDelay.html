The name of the delay element has no further meaning. The distribution or the expression of the delay times can be used
to determine how long the individual clients have to wait while passing the element. A global distribution or expression,
which is always applied when no client-type-specific data are defined, and optionally an individual distribution or expression
can be specified for each client type.
