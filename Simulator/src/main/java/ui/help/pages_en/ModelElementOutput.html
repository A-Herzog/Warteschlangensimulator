<h1>Model element: Output</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, some definable status information are written to an output file.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the output element has no further meaning. The name of the file to which the data is to be written
can be specified using the filename field. Multiple data can be written for each client event whose order and
values can be defined via the table rows in the setting dialog of the output element.
</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>
The <a href="ModelElementOutputJS.html">Output (JS)</a> element allows to define more complex output formats
for the simulation data. On the other side the Output (JS) element will need much more computing time to be
executed during simulation.
