<h1>Model element: Transport destination</h1>

<p>
Teleport transports allow to timeless transport a client from a 
<a href="ModelElementTeleportSource.html">teleport transport source</a>
to a teleport transport destination.
In contrast to normal transports, this is not about modeling a clients's actual transport
(which may takes a certain amount of time and requires some resources), but to keep the model clear.
If a client enters a teleport transport source, he is immediately transported to the specified
teleport transport destination. Start and end points can be located in different places in the model;
unlike a transport over an edge, no connection line between start and finish is drawn.

<p>
The teleport transport destination elements are identified by their names when transporting
clients from a teleport transport source element to a teleport transport destination element.
