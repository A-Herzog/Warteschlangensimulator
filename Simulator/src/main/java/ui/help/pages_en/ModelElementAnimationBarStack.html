<h1>Model element: Simulation data as stacked bar plot</h1>

<p>
The simulation data as a stacked bar element allows to display the values of multiple expressions in the form of
a dynamically sized bar consisting of multiple segments during the animation of a model. Each computable expression
can be displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue lengths at individual stations as well as access
to all user-defined simulation variables). For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data element has no further meaning.
For the sum of the expressions to be displayed, a maximum value can be set 
otherwise the segments are scaled to fill the entry bar area.
