<h1>Model element: Signal</h1>

<p>
If a client passes a signal element, the signal corresponding to the name of the element is triggered.
<a href="ModelElementBarrier.html">Barrier</a> elements can be notified by such a signal and can release waiting clients.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the signal element is also the name of the signal that is triggered when a client passes the element.
In addition, a time period can be set by which the triggering of the signal is to be delayed after a client arrival.
If no delay time is set, the event is triggered as soon as a client arrives at the station.
