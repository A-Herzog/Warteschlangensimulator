<h1>Model editor</h1>

<p>
In the model editor, the queue model to be simulated can be defined.
By using the <b>Element</b> toolbar button, components can be added
to the drawing surface, and the <b>Edge</b> button can be used to 
insert connections edges between the components.
</p>

<p>
Elements can be selected individually (by holding down the <tt>Shift</tt> key if you want to select more than one element),
or by area selection, and then moved groupwise by <b>drag&amp;drop</b>.
By right-clicking on an element, a <b>context menu</b> with additional command options can be called.
</p>

<p>
By <b>double-clicking</b> (or pressing the <tt>Enter</tt> key on a selected element) a properties dialog for configuring the selected component can be opened.
The <tt>Delete</tt> key can be used to <b>remove</b> the selected elements. In addition to drag&amp;drop,
elements can also be <b>moved</b> by holding down the <tt>Alt</tt> keys and using the cursor keys.
If the <tt>Shift</tt> key is pressed while dragging and dropping the elements or using the cursor keys to move them,
the selected element can be moved pixel-wise, otherwise they are moved along a grid.
</p>

<p>
By using the <b>middle mouse button</b> the function for adding connection edges can
be switched on or off without needing to click the Edge button.
</p>

<p>
An overview of all available <b>elements</b> can be found on the <a href="index.html">help content</a> page.
