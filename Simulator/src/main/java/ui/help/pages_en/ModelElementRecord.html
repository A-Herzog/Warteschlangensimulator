<h1>Model element: Data recording</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, the values of one or two user-defined expressions
are recorded to the statistics. If one expression is given, the values will be presented
as a line diagrame. On two expressions a X-Y points diagram will be created.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

In contrast to an <a href="ModelElementOutput.html">Output</a> element the data recoding element
is no recording to an external file but will keep the recorded values in memory to be able to
directly present them in the statistics viewer. For this reason the maximum number of recorded
values is limited to 2 million. When storing the statistics to a xml file and when displaying
line diagrams, up to 2 million values are used. For X-Y point diagrams and in tables only up to
2<sup>17</sup> values will be used.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The data will be recorded in the statistics under the name of the data recording element. 
At least one expression whose values are to be recorded has to be specified.
The second expression is optional.
