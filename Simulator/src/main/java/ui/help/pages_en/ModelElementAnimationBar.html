<h1>Model element: Simulation data as bar plot</h1>

<p>
The simulation data as a bar element allows to display the value of an expression in the form of a dynamically sized
bar during the animation of a model. Each computable expression can be displayed (which includes the functions for
determining queue lengths at individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation variables).
For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data element has no further meaning.
For the expression to be displayed, a range can be set which the bar should represent.
