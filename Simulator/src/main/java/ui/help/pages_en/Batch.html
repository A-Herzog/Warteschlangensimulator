<h1>Batch processing</h1>

<p>
The batch processing function allows to apply two types of functions
to each of the matching files in the selected directory:
</p> 

<h2>Simulation</h2>

<p>
In this mode, all models and parameter series configurations located in the specified directory are processed.
If a file is named <tt>Model.xml</tt>, the results for it are stored in <tt>Results-Model.zip</tt>.
In this way, the simulator can also check for which input files simulation results are already available.
If the processing of a directory is interrupted, only the models or parameter series configurations for
which output files are not yet available are processed when processing is resumed.
