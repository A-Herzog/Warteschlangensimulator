<h1>Java plugins folder dialog</h1>

<p>
In Java code used at script stations can call Java code in external class files.
Two techniques are available for this purpose:
</p>

<h2>Plugin interface</h2>

<p>
External classes can implement methods with the following signature:
</p>

<p><tt>
public Object methodName(final scripting.java.RuntimeInterface runtime, final scripting.java.SystemInterface system, final Object data)
</tt></p>

<p>
These methods can be accessed in the internal Java code via the following method:
</p>

<p><tt>sim.getSystem().runPlugin("className","methodName",data)</tt></p>

<p>
If a directory is selected in the dialog, the class files found in each case
and the matching methods contained therein are automatically listed in the list view.
Only those classes are listed which contain methods according to the signature described above.
</p>



<h2>Import of external classes</h2>

<p>
External classes located in the subdirectories of the specified directory can be made available directly via
<tt>import</tt> statements. Note that the classes must <b>not</b> be located in the specified plugin directory itself,
but in its <b>subdirectories</b>, and that a suitable <tt>package</tt> identifier has to be specified in the classes.
</p>

<p>
The import is done automatically by the simulator. No manual <tt>import</tt> configurations have to be made.
Only the base directory where the external classes are located has to be specified.
</p>



<h2>General information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A general documentation of the available Java commands is available on the help page
  <a href="Java.html">Documentation of Java commands</a>.</li>
  <li>If a class file was loaded or used by the simulator for the first time, it can remain
  locked until the simulator is terminated. This means that in particular it is not ensured
  that <tt>class</tt> files in the plugins directory can be exchanged at runtime of the simulator.</li>
</ul>
