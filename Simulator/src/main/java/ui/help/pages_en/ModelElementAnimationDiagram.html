<h1>Model element: Simulation data line chart</h1>

<p>
A simulation data line chart allows you to continuously display the value of one or more expressions
in the form of a continuously updated line graph during the animation of a model.
All computable expressions can be displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue
lengths at individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation variables).
For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data line chart element has no further meaning.
For the expressions to be displayed in the line chart, any valid expressions can be used;
a value range can be set for each expression.
