<h1>Model element: Throughput</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, the associated counter is incremented by one
and the current time is recorded. In this way, it is possible to measure the client
throughput per time unit through this element.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the throughput element has no further meaning for the simulation itself.
But a name has to be specified for the element because the measured throughput is
displayed using this name in the statistics.
</p>

<p>
Using the two options <b>Condition for counting</b> and <b>Only capture specific client types</b>,
additional conditions can be defined that have to be met for a client passing through the station to be counted.
If no conditions are defined, all clients are counted.
