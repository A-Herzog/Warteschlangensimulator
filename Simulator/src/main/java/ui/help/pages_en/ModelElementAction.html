<h1>Model element: Action</h1>

<p>
"Action" elements are not connected to the regular flow of clients.
"Action" elements trigger different actions when some conditions are matched.
</p>

<p>
These action types can be triggered by an "Action" element:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assigning a value to a variable</li>
  <li>Changing the value at an element containing an analog value
  (<a href="ModelElementAnalogValue.html">Analog value</a> or <a href="ModelElementTank.html">Tank</a>)</li>
  <li>Triggering a signal</li>
  <li>Running some Javascript or Java code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the "Action" element has no further meaning for the simulation.
In each "Action" element any number of actions can be defined. Each action
consists of a trigger (a condition to be fulfilled, an exceeded threshold value or a signal)
and some action to be executed (see above).
