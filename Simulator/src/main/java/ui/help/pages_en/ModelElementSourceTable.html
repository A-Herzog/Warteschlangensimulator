<h1>Model element: Table source</h1>

<p>
The client source represents the starting point of the movement of a client through the system.
A simulation model can consist of one or more source elements.
At a table-based source clients are not created based on inter-arrival times but the
times are loaded from a table.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the table source element has no meaning for the simulation.
At a table source the <b>file name of the table</b> from which the arrivals
are to be loaded and the <b>list of the client types</b> for which client
arrivals are to be loaded from the table have to be specified.
</p>

<p>
If a table is to be used <b>directly without preprocessing</b> at a table source, 
the meaning of the table columns has to be configured via the dialog that can be
called up via the gearwheel symbol to the right of the input field
for the file name of the table. In case of a <b>preprocessed</b> table this is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
<u>Format of a preprocessed table:</u><br>
Tables to be used at a table source element have to consist of at least two columns.
The first column has to contain the time stamps of the individual client arrivals
or the inter-arrival times. The values represent the number of seconds since the
start of the simulation or since the last client arrival.
In the second column the client type names of clients which arrive at the times
noted in the first column are defined. Rows containing a client type which is
not in the client types list in the table source element are ignored.
All optional further columns have to contain expressions of the following form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>ClientData(nr)=Formula</tt><br>
  Assigns the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> to the numeric
  client data field with index <tt>nr</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>ClientData('key')=TextValue</tt><br>
  Assigns <tt>TextValue</tt> to <tt>key</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>w=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the waiting time counter of the client.</li>  
  <li><tt>t=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the transport time counter of the client.</li>  
  <li><tt>p=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the service time counter of the client.</li>
  <li><tt>wCosts=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the waiting time depending costs counter of the client.</li>
  <li><tt>tCosts=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the transport time depending costs counter of the client.</li>
  <li><tt>pCosts=Formula</tt><br>
  Sets the result of the evaluation of <tt>formula</tt> as the
  initial value of the service time depending costs counter of the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using these expression new client objects can get client-specific data directly. 
</p>

<u>Hint:</u>
The button to the right of the table file input line can be used to open the 
<a href="ProcessClientTable.html">Prepare table for table source</a> dialog,
where tables in normal column form can be converted to tables in the format described above.
