<h1>Model element: Conveyor</h1>

<p>
A conveyor delays all arriving clients for a fixed time.
Additionally a conveyor has a limited capacity and each
arriving client can need a different amount of this capacity.
Clients for which there is not enough free transport capacity
will need to wait in a queue.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the conveyor element has no further meaning for the simulation.
For each conveyor an available transport capacity and a needed capacity for
transporting a single client (optional per client type) can be defined.
Transporting a client along the conveyor will take some defineable fixed
time. This means a client cannot overtake another client on the conveyor.
Additionally the movement direction of the clients on the conveyor during
the animation can be set up.
