<h1>Model element: Simulation data bar chart</h1>

<p>
A simulation data bar chart allows you to display the value of one or more expressions
in the form of a bar chart during the animation of a model.
All computable expressions can be displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue
lengths at individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation variables).
For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data bar chart element has no further meaning.
For the expressions to be displayed in the bar chart, any valid expressions can be used;
additional a value range can be set.
