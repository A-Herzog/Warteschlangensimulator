<h1>Model element: Balking</h1>

<p>
The Balking element checks if clients are waiting at the next process station reachable
on the direct way. In this case the condition (which may contain random expressions depending
on some client properties) is evaluated. If the condition is true, the client will balk to
enter the queue and leaves the Balking element by the connection which is intended for this
case.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the Balking element has no further meaning for the simulation.
The entered expression will be evaluated if there is a queue of waiting
clients on the next process station and determines if the client is willing
to enter the queue or if he is balking to do so. As expression a condition or
a balking probability can be entered. The value can also be set up global or
by client type.
