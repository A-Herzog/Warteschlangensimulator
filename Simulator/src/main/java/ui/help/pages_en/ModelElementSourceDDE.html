<h1>Model element: Excel DDE source</h1>

<p>
The client source represents the starting point of the movement of a client through the system.
A simulation model can consist of one or more source elements.
At a DDE table-based source clients are not created based on inter-arrival times but the
times are loaded via DDE from a table.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the Excel DDE source element has no meaning for the simulation.
At a Excel DDE source the <b>DDE connection settings</b>
(workbook, table, starting cell) via which the arrivals are to be loaded and the
<b>list of the client types</b> for which client
arrivals are to be loaded from the table have to be specified.
</p>

<p>
<u>Format of the table:</u><br>
Tables to be used at a Excel DDE source element have to consist of at least two columns.
The first column has to contain the time stamps of the individual client arrivals
or the inter-arrival times. The values represent the number of seconds since the
start of the simulation or since the last client arrival.
In the second column the client type names of clients which arrive at the times
noted in the first column are defined. Rows containing a client type which is
not in the client types list in the table source element are ignored.
All optional further columns have to contain expressions of the form
<tt>ClientData(nr)=Formula</tt>, <tt>ClientData('key')=TextValue</tt>,
<tt>w=Formula</tt>, <tt>t=Formula</tt>, <tt>p=Formula</tt>,
<tt>wCosts=Formula</tt>, <tt>tCosts=Formula</tt> or <tt>pCosts=Formula</tt>.
Using these expression new client objects can get client-specific data directly.
