<h1>Model element: Match</h1>

<p>
The match element has two or more inputs. If a client is present at each of the inputs, they are forwarded simultaneously
at the same time or a temporary or a permanent batch is built. If clients are only present at one input line, they have
to wait until clients have also arrived at the other input lines.
In addition, a restriction can be made to only match clients in which a particular client data field has the same
numeric or text value and a condition which has to be met for matching clients can be defined.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the match element has no further meaning. For the match element it can be set whether the combined
clients simply leave the station again (at the same time), or whether a temporary batch (which
can be dissolved by the <a href="ModelElementSeparate.html">Dissolve batch</a> element) or whether the route
through the network ends for the clients ends at this point (because the two clients, for example, represent
partial components that are combined into a larger element) and instead a new client object is created and
started from this point. Additionally a client data field can be defined to be used for matching and a
condition which has to be met for matching clients can be defined.
