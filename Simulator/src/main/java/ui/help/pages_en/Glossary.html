<h1>Glossary</h1>

<h2>Cancelation rate</h2>

<p>
If the client at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> only has a limited waiting time tolerance,
then the cancelation rate indicates the reciprocal of the average waiting time tolerance.
In <a href="QueueingCalculator.html">queueing theory</a>, the cancelation rate is also denoted by &nu;.
</p>

<h2>Cancel time</h2>

<p>
If a client has given up waiting at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> because he would have to wait longer
than his personal waiting time tolerance allows, the client's wait time is shown in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics viewer</a>
as his cancel time.
</p>

<h2>Arrival time</h2>

<p>
The arrival rate is the inverse of the inter-arrival times at a <a href="ModelElementSource.html">source station</a>.
In <a href="QueueingCalculator.html">queueing theory</a>, the arrival rate is also denoted by &lambda;.
</p>

<h2>Utilization</h2>

<p>
The utilization of the operator groups displayed in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a> indicates the proportion
of the available time that the operators were busy serving customers in each case. Consequently, the utilization is a value between
0 and 1. The utilization is denoted in <a href="QueueingCalculator.html">queueing theory</a> by &rho;.
</p>

<h2>Autocorrelation</h2>

<p>
In the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">model properties dialog</a>, the auto correlation of the waiting times can be set to be recorded
during the simulation. The autocorrelation indicates how strongly the waiting time of a client depends on the waiting times of the
immediately preceding clients. Based on the autocorrelation of the waiting times, it can be decided how much residual dependency should
be accepted for defining a batch-means batch size. The batch-means method then allows confidence intervals for the metrics to be reported
in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a>.
</p>

<h2>Batch</h2>

<p>
If multiple clients arrive simultaneously at a <a href="ModelElementSource.html">source station</a> or if multiple clients are served
simultaneously at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>, these are referred to as batch arrivals or batch services.
Clients can also be explicitly combined into a batch at a <a href="ModelElementBatch.html">batch station</a>.
</p>

<h2>Batch-means method</h2>

<p>
The batch-means method allows to display confidence intervals for the characteristics in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a>.
This is not possible in a direct way, because, for example, the waiting times of the immediately successive clients are dependent and this is
not permitted for the confidence interval calculation. The batch size to be used for the batch-means method can be determined via autocorrelation
detection. Both methods can be configured in the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">model properties dialog</a>.
</p>

<h2>Service rate</h2>

<p>
The service rate is the reciprocal of the average service time at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>.
The service rate is also denoted by &mu; in <a href="QueueingCalculator.html">queueing theory</a>.
</p>


<h2>Service rule</h2>

<p>
The service rule specifies which of several waiting clients should be served next
at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>. The concrete service
rules are mapped at a process station via the priorities.
</p>

<h2>Service times</h2>

<p>
The service times can be used at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> to define how long
the process of serving a client (or in the case of batch processing of a client batch) by an operator should take.
In the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a>, the service times are denoted by <b>S</b>.
</p>

<h2>Residence times</h2>

<p>
Residence times, denoted <b>V</b> in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a>,
indicates the total amount of time a client has spent in the system or at a station.
</p>

<h2>Economy of scale</h2>

<p>
The economy of scale or the positive scale effect describes the effect in many production systems
that the unit production costs are lower in a larger system than in a smaller system.
The reason for this may be that the fixed costs are distributed over more units, or that fluctuations
caused by stochastic inter-arrival and service times can be better balanced out in larger systems.
</p>

<h2>Erlang formulas</h2>

<p>
With the help of the Erlang B and Erlang C formulas, simple queueing models can be calculated exactly.
In the <a href="QueueingCalculator.html">queueing calculator</a> the values of these formulas can be calculated directly.
</p>

<h2>Flow factor</h2>

<p>
The flow factor shown in the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a> is the ratio of residence time to service time.
The flow factor has a minimum of 1. A flow factor of 1 means that no waiting times occurred. A flow factor of 2 means that
clients had to wait as long as their service process took, and so on.
</p>

<h2>Closed queueing network</h2>

<p>
In a closed queueing network, a finite, fixed number of clients circulate. Unlike an open queueing network,
a closed queueing network usually has no <a href="ModelElementDispose.html">exit</a>. Since the recording
of times on a per-client basis usually occurs when a client leaves the system, to record times in a closed
queueing network it is necessary to specify in the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">model properties dialog</a>
that clients who have not yet left the system at the end of the simulation should also be recorded.
</p>

<h2>Post-processing times</h2>

<p>
The post-processing time is the period of time that an operator at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>
needs after completing the service of a client before he is available again for further service processes.
During the post-processing time, the previously served client is already no longer at the processstation.
</p>

<h2>Open queueing network</h2>

<p>
An open queueing network represents the normal case for a model in Warteschlangensimulator:
Clients arrive at one or more <a href="ModelElementSource.html">sources stations</a>,
are served at one or more <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process stations</a>,
and ultimately exit the system via one or more <a href="ModelElementDispose.html">exits</a>.
Closed queueing networks, in which a finite, fixed number of clients circulate continuously,
represent a counter design to this.
</p>

<h2>Prioritization</h2>

<p>
The prioritization of clients at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>
determines which of the waiting clients will be served next when an operator becomes available.
In each case, the client with the highest priority is served next.
</p>

<h2>Pull production</h2>

<p>
In pull production, a station only performs an operation when the respective downstream station
requests a client or a workpiece, i.e. the clients are pulled through production by the
respective downstream stations. In this way, stocks at the individual stations can be limited.
However, on the one hand a special control system is required and on the other hand it must be
ensured that enough buffers are nevertheless available so that the process stations are not
unnecessarily idle even in this case.
</p>

<h2>Push production</h2>

<p>
Push production represents the default case in a queueing model. When a process station has
finished serving a client, it pushes the client to the next station. The forwarding of the
client is independent of how many clients are already waiting at the next station.
</p>

<h2>Setup times</h2>

<p>
Setup times can occur at <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process stations</a> if the station
has to be reconfigured as such when changing from one client type to another.
The setup time is upstream of the respective service time of a client.
</p>

<h2>Impatience</h2>

<p>
If clients at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a> are only willing to wait
a limited amount of time to be served, this is referred to as client impatience.
How long clients are willing to wait in this case before they give up waiting and leave the
station without being served is determined by the clients' waiting time tolerances.
</p>

<h2>Warm-up phase</h2>

<p>
Before the waiting and service times are counted for the statistics, a certain number of clients can pass through
the system that are not counted for the statistics. In the <a href="EditorModelDialog.html">model properties dialog</a>,
you can set how long this warm-up phase should be.
</p>

<h2>Waiting cancelations</h2>

<p>
If a client has only a limited waiting time tolerance and his previous waiting time exceeds his
individual waiting time tolerance, he cancels waiting without being served.
</p>

<h2>Waiting room</h2>

<p>
A waiting room is an integral part of any <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>.
In the waiting room, a client waits before an operator is available to serve him.
</p>

<h2>Waiting time</h2>

<p>
Client waiting times occur in particular at <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process stations</a>.
A client always has to wait when there is currently no operator available to serve him.
In the <a href="MainStatistik.html">statistics view</a>, waiting times are denoted by <b>W</b>.
</p>

<h2>Waiting time tolerance</h2>

<p>
The waiting time tolerance specifies how long clients at a <a href="ModelElementProcess.html">process station</a>
are willing to wait for their service. No waiting time tolerance needs to be defined; in this case, clients are
willing to wait any amount of time. If a finite waiting time tolerance is defined and a client exceeds this
waiting time tolerance, he aborts the waiting process and leaves the process station without being served.
</p>

<h2>Inter-arrival times</h2>

<p>
The inter-arrival times specify at a <a href="ModelElementSource.html">source station</a> the time intervals between
the arrivals of two consecutive clients. The longer the inter-arrival times, the fewer clients arrive in the system per unit of time.
