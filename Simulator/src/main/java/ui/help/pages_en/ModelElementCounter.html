<h1>Model element: Counter</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, the associated counter is incremented by one.
In this way, it is possible to measure how many clients have chosen a specific path in the simulation model.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
In addition to the name of the counter, a group name for the counter has also to be specified.
Next to the respective absolute value, the proportion of the counter within its respective group
will be indicated in the statistics.
</p>

<p>
Using the two options <b>Condition for counting</b> and <b>Only capture specific client types</b>,
additional conditions can be defined that have to be met for a client passing through the station to be counted.
If no conditions are defined, all clients are counted.
