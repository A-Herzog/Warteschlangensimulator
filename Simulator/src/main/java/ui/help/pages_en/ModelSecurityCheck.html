If a model is to be loaded which contains stations which can have influences
on the system (this are stations with script execution and with file or
database output) a warning dialog is displayed. (If this feature is activated
in the settings.) In this dialog the critical stations with its special
settings are listed and the user can choose if the model is to
be loaded or if the loading should be canceled due to security reasons.
