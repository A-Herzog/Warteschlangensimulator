<h1>Simulation results</h1>

<p>
On simulation results page, the results are displayed in the form of texts, tables and graphs after a simulation run.
The data can in each case be exported in suitable formats (e.g., Excel tables or images).
</p>

<h2>Fast access</h2>

<p>
The fast access feature allows to present simulation results always in exactly the same user-defined format
for example for saving them in table form. By using the filter settings at the bottom of this page you can
define which data are to be exported and in which format.

<p>
The filtering can be done by list consisting of the records to be output and by scripts in <b>Javascript</b>
or in <b>Java</b>. Depending on the selected language in the scripts some 
<a href="JS.html">additional Javascript commands</a> or <a href="JS.html">additional Java commands</a>
are available for accessing the statistics data.
</p>

<h2>Generate report</h2>
