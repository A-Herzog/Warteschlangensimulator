<h1>Model element: Text by simulation data</h1>

<p>
The text by simulation data element allows to display different strings depending on some conditions.
Any computable expression can be used as a condition to select as string (which includes the functions for
determining queue lengths at individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation
variables). The output is in text form on the drawing surface. For classical simulation, the simulation
data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data element is displayed on the drawing area directly above the conditional string.
You can define any number of conditions and strings and also one default string which is displayed,
if non of the conditions apply.
