<h1>Arrange elements dialog</h1>

<p>
The functions offered in this dialog allow to arrange the stations on the drawing surface.
Only stations in the flow chart are taken into account. Elements for visual design are not moved.
It is possible to select whether the stations should only be aligned to the ^main grid or
whether the flow diagram should be completely rebuilt based on the edges between the stations.
