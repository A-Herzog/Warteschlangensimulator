<h1>Edit imports for user-defined Java code dialog</h1>

<p>
The Java code which can be used at the various stations is
automatically provided with a set of import statements so that
the usual auxiliary classes can be accessed within the code.
In this dialog, the default values for the imports can be changed
to make additional classes accessible within the user-defined
Java code, if necessary, or to further restrict the use of the auxiliary classes.
