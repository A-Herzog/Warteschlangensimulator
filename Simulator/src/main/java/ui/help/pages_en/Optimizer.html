<h1>Optimizer</h1>

<p>
In the optimizer, areas to vary some model parameters within can be defined.
Furthermore, a target variable can be specified and set whether it should be
maximized, minimized or maintain a certain range. The optimizer then tries
to vary the predetermined model parameters within the respective permissible
ranges in such a way that the desired optimum is achieved.
</p>

<p>
The optimizer window consists of three pages:
</p>


<h2>Control variables</h2>

<p>
On this page you can set which variables in the model can be varied in
which range to achieve the desired goal. In addition, it can be specified
per variable whether it can accept any numerical values (in the specified range)
or only integers.
</p>

<h2>Target</h2>

<p>
On this page the optimization target is defined. The target value can either 
be the value of an XML statistic element or the return value of a script.
Furthermore, it can be set whether the target value should be as large as possible
or as small as possible or should be within a certain target range.
</p>

<h2>Optimization</h2>

<p>
The main section of the optimization page is used to display status output
during the optimization process. Above this main area you can set up the
directory in which the statistics files representing the individual optimization
steps are to be saved and whether during optimization a variable should first
be changed to its best possible value and then switched to the next variable
or whether all variables are only to be changed one piece in each turn.
