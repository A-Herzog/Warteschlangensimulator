<h1>Network server services</h1>

<p>
The Warteschlangensimulator provides two network server services that can be configured,
started, and stopped in this dialog. The two services are not connected to each other
and can be used independently.
</p>

<h2>Simulation network server</h2>

<p>
The simulation network server service allows to use the current Warteschlangensimulator instance
as a calculation server for remote installations. If the server service is started, the program
dialog page can be closed; the server is running until the program is closed.
</p>

<p>
To access the server from a Warteschlangensimulator installation, the server connection data
has to be specified in the <a href="Setup.html">setup</a> dialog.
</p>

<h2>Web server</h2>

<p>
The web server allows to submit work orders in the form of model xml files and parameter series xml files
via a web interface to Warteschlangensimulator. The requests are processed in order of receipt and the
results are offered for download as statistics xml files.
</p>

<h2>Remote control server</h2>

<p>
The web server allows to query the status of an animation via the http protocol in the form
of json objects and also to control the animation via this interface.
</p>

<h2>DDE-Server</h2>

<p>
The DDE server allows to query the status of an animation via the dynamic data exchange protocol
and also to control the animation via this interface. The simulator registers itself as service "QS"
and offers the topics "Status" and "Calc". "Status" contains the four items
"Version", "Model", "Changed" und "Mode". "Calc" can be used to calculate expressions in the
context of the animation by offering them as DDE items. Additionally the two DDE commands
"step" and "quit" can be used to control active animations.
