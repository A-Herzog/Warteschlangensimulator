<h1>Coefficients of variation</h1>

<p>
The coefficient of variation represents a normalized version of the
<a href="statistic_standard deviation.html">standard deviation</a>.
Just like the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation never
takes on values smaller than 0 and a value of 0 means that the
measurement series consists of only one value.
</p>

<h3>Relationship with the standard deviation</h3>
<p>
In contrast to the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation
is independent of the average value of the measurement series, so
that different measurement series can be compared directly with
regard to the strength of the variation via their coefficients of variation.
</p>
<p>
In concrete terms, the coefficient of variation is calculated as the
quotient of the standard deviation and the average value.
</p>

<h3>Squared coefficient of variation</h3>
<p>
Besides the coefficient of variation, there is also the
squared coefficient of variation. This is either obtained
by squaring the coefficient of variation or by forming
the quotient of the variance and the square of the average value.
</p>

<h3>Identifier</h3>
<p>
The coefficient of variation of the measurement series X
is usually designated by CV[X] and the squared coefficient
of variation by SCV[X].
</p>

<h3>Typical values</h3>
<p>
A coefficient of variation of 0 means that all values of the
measurement series are identical. The measured values, which
are based on an exponential distribution, have a coefficient
of variation of 1. 
</p>
<p>
In manufacturing processes, the coefficient of variation of
service times usually depends on how much human interaction
is required in the respective step. Typical values range from
less than 0.3 for purely robotic manufacturing, to 0.3 to 0.6
for partially manual work steps, to values from 0.6 to over
1 for fully manual work steps.
