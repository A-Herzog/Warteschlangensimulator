<h1>Model element: Decide and teleport</h1>

<p>
Teleport transports allow to timeless transport a client from a teleport transport source
to a <a href="ModelElementTeleportDestination.html">teleport transport destination</a>.
In contrast to normal transports, this is not about modeling a clients's actual transport
(which may takes a certain amount of time and requires some resources), but to keep the model clear.
If a client enters a teleport transport source, he is immediately transported to the specified
teleport transport destination. Start and end points can be located in different places in the model;
unlike a transport over an edge, no connection line between start and finish is drawn.
</p>

<p>
A Decide and Teleport station combines the functions of a
einer <a href="ModelElementDecide.html">Decide</a> station with a
<a href="ModelElementTeleportSource.html">Teleport transport source</a> station:
In a first step, the client object is branched into several directions.
Then the client object is sent to the selected destination via a teleport transport.
</p>

<p>
The branching can be carried out according to the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Random:</b>
    For each exit direction a rate is specified, which determines the probability for this route.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Condition:</b>
    Conditions are defined for all output directions (except for the last direction).
    If a client arrives, these conditions are checked from top to bottom.
    The client is forwarded in the direction in which the condition was fulfilled for the first time.
    If none of the conditions apply, the customer is forwarded in the last direction
    (for which no condition is specified).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Client type:</b>
    Client types are defined for all output directions (except for the last direction).
    If an arriving client is of one of these types, it is forwarded in the corresponding direction.
    If the type of the arrived client does not correspond to any of the specified client types,
    the client is forwarded in the last direction (for which no client type is specified).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sequence:</b>
    One of the clients is directed to one of the outputs in sequence. After a client is routed to the last
    connected output, the next client is routed back to the first output.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Shortest queue at the next station:</b>
    Routes the client to the path where the next station
    has the shortest queue. In the case of the same value
    for multiple paths, a random decision will be made.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Shortest queue at the next process station:</b>
    Routes the client to the path where the next process station
    has the shortest queue. Stations between the decide element
    and the process station on the path will be ignored when
    calculating the queue length. In the case of the same value
    for multiple paths, a random decision will be made.
    
  </li>
  <li> 
    <b>Least number of clients at the next station:</b>
    Routes the client to the path where the next station
    has the least current number of clients. In the case of the same value
    for multiple paths, a random decision will be made.    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Least number of clients at the next process station:</b>
    Routes the client to the path where the next process station
    has the least current number of clients. Stations between the decide element
    and the process station on the path will be ignored when
    calculating the number of clients at the process station.    
    In the case of the same value
    for multiple paths, a random decision will be made.    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Text property:</b>
    Values are defined for all output directions (except for the last direction).
    If some special key of an arriving client has the specified value , the client
    is forwarded in the corresponding direction.
    If the value of the arrived client does not correspond to any of the specified values,
    the client is forwarded in the last direction (for which no value is specified).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<h3>Mode "Random"</h3>
<p>
The forwarding probabilities in the various possible output directions need not be given in the form
of probabilities which have to sum up to 1, but it is sufficient to specify rates. These rates are
automatically normalized by the program to probabilities. The following prerequisites apply:
The rates may not be negative and at least one of the specified rates has to be greater than 0.
</p>

<h3>Mode "Condition"</h3>
<p>
For each existing direction, a condition has to be specified under which the clients are routed in this
direction. The conditions do not have to be mutually exclusive and are tested from top to bottom.
No condition can be specified for the last direction. This direction is selected in the simulation
whenever none of the previous conditions were true.
</p>

<h3>Mode "Client type"</h3>
<p>
For each direction, a client type has to be specified whose clients are routed in this direction.
No client type can be specified for the last direction. This direction is selected in the simulation
whenever none of the previous conditions were true.
</p>

<h3>Mode "Text property"</h3>
<p>
A clients key from which the values are to be read has to be specified.
Additionally for each direction, a value has to be specified. If the client key has this value the client
is routed in this direction. No value can be specified for the last direction. This direction is selected in the simulation
whenever none of the previous conditions were true.
