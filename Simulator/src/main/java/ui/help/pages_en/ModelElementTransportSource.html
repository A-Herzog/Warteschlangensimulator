<h1>Model element: Transport origin</h1>

<p>
A transport origin element allows to transport a client to any
<a href="ModelElementTransportDestination.html">transport destination</a>
element. How much time is needed for the transport and to which
transport destination element the client is transported can be set up
in the transport origin element. 
There is no need for a connection edge between the transport origin element
and the transport destination element for routing clients from the origin to the
destination.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the transport origin element has no further meaning.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Transport times</b> one can define how long the transportation
of a client will take. The transport times can be defined by a probability distribution
or by an expression. Additionally it can be set up if the transport time should be recorded
as waiting time, transfer time (default) oder process time.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Routing destinations</b> target stations for transfering the
clients can be registered. Conditions or client types can be specified for the transport
destinations. Alternatively the clients sequence or a clients text property can be used to determine
the transport destination.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Needed resource</b> a resource which is needed to transport
the client to the destination station can be selected. Next to the type of the
resource the quantity of operators from the resource needed to transport one
client can be defined. Additionally a delayed release time can be set up.
If a delayed release is selected the resource will not be released immediately
after arrival of the client on the destination station but some time later.
This can be used to model the return time of the resource to the origin
station.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Leave section</b> optionally an enter section station can be specified.
When the transport of the client starts, the corresponding section will be left.
