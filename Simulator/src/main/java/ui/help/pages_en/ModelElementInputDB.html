<h1>Model element: Input (DB)</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, a numerical value is read from a
database table and assigned to a variable. The reading position then is moved by one line.
If a client is reaching the end of the file, different actions can be processed.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the input element has no further meaning for the simulation.
Next to the database connection settings, the table and the column to load
the intended behavior at the end of the file and the name of the variable
where the value is to be assigned to have to be specified.
</p> 

<p>
By using the pseudo variables "w", "t" and "p" you can access the waiting time, the transfer time and the
process time of the current client (each on second base) for reading and for writing. Additionally you can
write to a client object data field by using "ClientData(index)" as target variable or a text to a client-based
key by using "ClientData('key')".
