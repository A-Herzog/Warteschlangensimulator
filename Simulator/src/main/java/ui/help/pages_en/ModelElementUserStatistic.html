<h1>Model element: User-defined statistic data</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, some user-definable statistic information are recorded.

<p>
The name of the user-defined statistic data element has no further meaning.
Each user-defined statistic data element can contain any number of records
describing which information is to be recorded when a client passes through
this station. The recording can take place in the form of discrete values
(standard case) or continuously over time. If actual client characteristics
(such as waiting times, etc.) are to be recorded, the values are discrete.
Continuous recording only makes sense if the arrival of a client at the station
is to be used to record the change in a value that does not necessarily have
anything to do with the respective client.
