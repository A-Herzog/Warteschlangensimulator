<h1>Model element: User-defined statistic data</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, some user-definable statistic information are recorded.
The recording can optionally be differentiated by client type and time interval.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the user-defined statistic data element has no further meaning.
Each user-defined statistic data element can contain any number of records
describing which information is to be recorded when a client passes through
this station. The recording can take place in the form of discrete values
(standard case) or continuously over time. If actual client characteristics
(such as waiting times, etc.) are to be recorded, the values are discrete.
Continuous recording only makes sense if the arrival of a client at the station
is to be used to record the change in a value that does not necessarily have
anything to do with the respective client.
</p>
<p>
In the default case, one statistics entry is created per data record,
in which the data of all clients passing through the station is recorded.
However, a client type-specific recording can also be set. In this case,
an individual data record is created for each client type that passes through
the station, the name of which is composed of a specified data record name
and the name of the client type.
</p>
<p>
Interval-based recording can also be activated.
In this case, the number and average value of the values recorded
in the interval is recorded for each interval (the length of which can be set)
for each discrete-time value. Recording begins at the end of the warm-up phase.
