<h1>Copy Warteschlangensimulator installation dialog</h1>

<p>
In many cases it is useful to install Warteschlangensimulator e.g. on a USB stick
in order to be able to demonstrate a model during a presentation on a remote computer.
This can always be done at any time by downloading the zip variant of the simulator from

<p>

</p>

<p>
and then unpacking it in the target directory. However, a normal installation
can also be copied directly to another directory at any time - without a new download.
</p>

<p>
The function offered in this dialog automates this process.
All you have to do is specify the desired target directory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
This program function will not be offered if the simulator is already running in portable mode.
In this case, the installation folder can simply be copied using a file manager.
