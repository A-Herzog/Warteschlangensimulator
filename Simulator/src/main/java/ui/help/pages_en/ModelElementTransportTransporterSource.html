<h1>Model element: Transporter start</h1>


<p>
A transporter start element allows to transport a client to any
<a href="ModelElementTransportDestination.html">transport destination</a>
element. How much time is needed for the transport and to which
transport destination element the client is transported can be set up
in the transporter start element. 
There is no need for a connection edge between the transport origin element
and the transport destination element for routing clients from the origin to the
destination.
In comparison to the  <a href="ModelElementTransportSource.html">transport origin</a>
element at a transporter start element no resources (which do not have a physical location)
are used but transporters which move between the stations.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the transporter start element has no further meaning.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Transporter</b>, it is possible to specify which type
of transporter is to be used to pick up for waiting clients, how many clients
have to wait before a transporter is being requested, and what priority the
transporter start element should have when requesting transporters.
Furthermore, even without waiting clients, transporters can be requested,
which then park in the element. Again, a priority and maximum capacity can be specified.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Routing destinations</b> target stations for transfering the
clients can be registered. Conditions or client types can be specified for the transport
destinations. Alternatively the clients sequence or a clients text property can be used to determine
the transport destination.
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Priorities</b> a priority for waiting clients
to get a place in an arriving transporter can be defined.
The variable "w" indicates here the client's previous waiting time at the current station.
(In all other cases "w" is the total waiting time of the current client.)
</p>

<p>
On the dialog page <b>Leave section</b> optionally an enter section station can be specified.
When the transport of the client starts, the corresponding section will be left.
