<h1>Model element: Analogue scale display</h1>

<p>
An analogue scale display element makes it possible to display the current
value of an expression on an analogue measuring scale by positioning the pointer.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation time element has no further meaning.
In addition to the calculation expression to be evaluated,
the maximum value of the scale must be specified. In addition,
a yellow and a red range (typically with values just below
the maximum) can optionally be specified. The corresponding
ranges are then displayed marked in color on the scale.
