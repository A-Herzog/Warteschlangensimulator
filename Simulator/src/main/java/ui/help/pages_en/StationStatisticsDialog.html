<h1>Record station statistics dialog</h1>

<p>
In the default case, the numbers of clients at the stations (total and waiting)
and the inter-arrival and inter-leaving times at all stations are recorded.
In this dialog you disable the recording for certain stations. This is may be
desirable for reasons of clarity in the statistics. Furthermore, a reduced
recording of statistical data slightly increases the simulation speed.
</p>

<p>
As long as there are no immediate reasons to reduce statistics collection,
it is recommended to always leave data collection active at all stations.
