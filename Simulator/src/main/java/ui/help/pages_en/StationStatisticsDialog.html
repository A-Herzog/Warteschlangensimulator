<h1>Record station statistics dialog</h1>

<h2>Statistic recording</h2>

<p>
In the default case, the numbers of clients at the stations (total and waiting)
and the inter-arrival and inter-leaving times at all stations are recorded.
In this dialog you disable the recording for certain stations. This is may be
desirable for reasons of clarity in the statistics. Furthermore, a reduced
recording of statistical data slightly increases the simulation speed.
</p>

<p>
As long as there are no immediate reasons to reduce statistics collection,
it is recommended to always leave data collection active at all stations.
</p>

<h2>Maximum throughput interval lengths</h2>

<p>
Since client arrivals are discrete events, the maximum throughput,
i.e. the maximum number of client arrivals per time unit, can only
be recorded via explicitly specified intervals. The interval length
to be used per station can be set on this dialog page.
</p>

<p>
For reasons of better comparability, it is recommended to use the
same value for all stations. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind
that stochastic effects average each other out the longer the intervals
are chosen, i.e. shorter intervals tend to lead to higher maximum throughputs.
