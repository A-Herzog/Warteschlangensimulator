<h1>Standard deviations and variances</h1>

<p>
In addition to the <a href="statistik_mittelwert.html">average value</a>,
standard deviation and variance together are the second important parameters
of a measurement series. The two values indicate how far the concrete values
deviate on average from the average value. A standard deviation of 0 means
that the measurement series consists of only one value. Negative standard
deviations are not possible. The greater the standard deviation, the more
the measured values of a measurement series vary.
</p>

<p>
In many cases it is very useful to consider the standard deviation of a series
of measurements in addition to the average value, because when a series of
measurements is compressed to only one parameter (the average value), too much
information that would be interesting for the analysis is often lost.
</p>

<h3>Relationship between standard deviation and variance</h3>
<p>
The variance is the squared standard deviation or the standard deviation
is the square root of the variance. When dealing analytically with
probability distributions, the variance is usually easier to calculate
than the standard deviation, so in stochastic formulas usually the 
variance is given first. From a practical point of view, the
standard deviation is usually easier to understand.
</p>

<h3>Identifier</h3>
<p>
The standard deviation of the measurement series X is usually
designated by Std[X] and the variance by Var[X].
</p>

<h3>Criticism</h3>
<p>
If different series of measurements are to be compared with
regard to their fluctuations, standard deviation and variance
can give a biased impression. These two quantities must always
be considered in relation to the associated average value.
If the service times of average 60 seconds fluctuate with
a standard deviation of 30 seconds, this represents a greater
fluctuation than service times of 3600 seconds which have
a standard deviation of 40 seconds. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="statistik_CV.html">coefficient of variation</a>
addresses exactly this problem. It provides a possibility
to compare different measurement series directly with respect
to their relative dispersion.
