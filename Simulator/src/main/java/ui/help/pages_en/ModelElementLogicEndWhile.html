<h1>Model element: EndWhile</h1>

<p>
The EndWhile element ends a loop started by a
<a href="ModelElementLogicWhile.html">While</a> element.
The client will be routed to the While element.
The While element checks if the condition is still
fulfilled. If not, the client will be routed to the
element following the EndWhile element. Otherwise
the loop will be executed another time.
