<h1>Model element: Database source</h1>

<p>
The client source represents the starting point of the movement of a client through the system.
A simulation model can consist of one or more source elements.
At a table-based source clients are not created based on inter-arrival times but the
times are loaded from a database table.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the database source element has no meaning for the simulation.
At each database source next to the database connection settings the
name of a database table from which the arrivals are to be loaded and
the names of the row containing the arrival times (in seconds), the
corresponding client types and optional a column for additional client
data have to be specified. Additional the names of the client types
which are to be respected when loading the database table have to
be specified.
</p>

<p>
The client data column has to contain expressions of the form 
"<tt>ClientData(1)=5</tt>" or "<tt>ClientData('key')=TextValue</tt>".
If multiple assignments are to be made for an arriving client
the expressions can be split by <b>tabs</b> in the cell.
