<h1>Model element: Batch</h1>

<p>
In this element, incoming clients have to wait until a certain number of clients are available.
These are then forwarded simultaneously or a temporary or a permanent batch is built.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the batch element has no further meaning. The minimum and the maximum batch size can be used
to set the number of clients that have to have arrived at minimum at the batch element before they are
forwarded (in batches with maximum the number of specified clients). Furthermore, it can be set whether
the combined clients simply leave the station again (at the same time), or whether a temporary batch (which
can be dissolved by the <a href="ModelElementSeparate.html">Dissolve batch</a> element) or whether the route
through the network ends for the clients ends at this point (because the two clients, for example, represent
partial components that are combined into a larger element) and instead a new client object is created and
started from this point.
