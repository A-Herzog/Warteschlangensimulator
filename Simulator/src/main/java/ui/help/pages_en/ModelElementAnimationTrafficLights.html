<h1>Model element: Simulation data traffic lights</h1>

<p>
The simulation data traffic lights element allows to display the value of an expression during the animation
in the form of a traffic light, which distinguishes two or three states. Each computable expression can be
displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue lengths at individual stations as well as
access to all user-defined simulation variables). For classical simulation, the simulation data elements
are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data traffic lights element has no further meaning.
In the case of a traffic light with three lights, the evaluation is carried out from the top to the bottom:
The condition for the yellow light is only checked if the condition for the red light is not already fulfilled.
