<h1>Model element: Transport origin (sequence)</h1>

<p>
<b>
This station type is no longer supported by the simulator.
The functionality of this station type is available directly in the
<a href="ModelElementTransportSource.html">transport start</a> element
now. 
</b>
</p>

<p>
A transport origin (sequence) element allows to transport a client to any
<a href="ModelElementTransportDestination.html">transport destination</a>
element. How much time is needed for the transport can be set up
in the transport start element. The transport destination is in contrast to the
<a href="ModelElementTransportSource.html">transport start</a> element
not determined in the station itself, but read out of the sequence plan
for the respective client object.
There is no need for a connection edge between the transport origin element
and the transport destination element for routing clients from the origin to the
destination.

<b>Transport times</b> one can define how long the transportation of a client will
take. The transport times can be defined by a probability distriution or by an
expression. Additionally it can be set up if the transport time should be recorded
as waiting time, transfer time (default) oder process time. On the dialog page
<b>Routing destinations</b> a target station which is used if there is not sequence
plan for the current client or the sequence plan has already ended.
