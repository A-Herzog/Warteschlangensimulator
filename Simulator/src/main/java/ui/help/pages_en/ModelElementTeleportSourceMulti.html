<h1>Model element: Duplicate and teleport</h1>

<p>
Teleport transports allow to timeless transport a client from a teleport transport source
to a <a href="ModelElementTeleportDestination.html">teleport transport destination</a>.
In contrast to normal transports, this is not about modeling a clients's actual transport
(which may takes a certain amount of time and requires some resources), but to keep the model clear.
If a client enters a teleport transport source, he is immediately transported to the specified
teleport transport destination. Start and end points can be located in different places in the model;
unlike a transport over an edge, no connection line between start and finish is drawn.
</p>

<p>
A Duplicate and Teleport station combines the functions of a
einer <a href="ModelElementDuplicate.html">Duplicate</a> station with a
<a href="ModelElementTeleportSource.html">Teleport transport source</a> station:
In a first step, the client object is divided into several similar objects
(always with the same data). Then the client objects are sent to all destinations
configured in the station simultaneously.

<p>
The name of the teleport transport source element has no further meaning for the simulation.
However, the names of <a href="ModelElementTeleportDestination.html">Teleport transport destination</a>
station are to be configured to define to which stations the arriving clients are to be transported.
