<h1>Model element: Button</h1>

<p>
"Button" elements are not connected to the regular flow of clients.
They can only be used during animation and will trigger one or more
action when they are clicked.
</p>

<p>
These action types can be triggered by an "Button" element:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assigning a value to a variable</li>
  <li>Changing the value at an element containing an analog value
  (<a href="ModelElementAnalogValue.html">Analog value</a> or <a href="ModelElementTank.html">Tank</a>)</li>
  <li>Triggering a signal</li>
  <li>Running some Javascript or Java code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the "Button" element has no further meaning for the simulation.
In each "Button" element any number of actions can be defined. The actions will
be executed if the button is clicked during animation.
