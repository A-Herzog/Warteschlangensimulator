<h1>Model element: Pull barrier</h1>

<p>
Pull barriers allow to control the number of clients in some segment.
he pull barrier will only release clients to the next station, if
the total number of clients beginning at this next station to another
(controlled) stations is smaller than a threshold value. This allows to
run some pull effect on the controlled station: If there are
fewer clients at the controlled station than the threshold value allows
at maximum and there are also not enough clients at the next station
following the pull barrier to fill up the queue at the controlled station,
then clients are released from the pull barrier station.

<p>
The name of the pull barrier element has no further meaning. The name of
the station at which the number of clients is to be controlled has
to be specified and also the maximum number of clients at this controlled
station.
