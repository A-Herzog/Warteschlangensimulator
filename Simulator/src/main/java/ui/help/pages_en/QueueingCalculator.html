Mit Hilfe des Warteschlangenrechners können mit Hilfe analytischer Formeln
Kenngrößen für einfache Warteschlangensysteme berechnet werden.

<p>
The queueing calculator allows to use analytical formulas to 
get performance indicators for some simple queueing models.
</p>

<h2>Work load</h2>
<p>
The work load &rho; is calculated as the ratio of arrival rate &lambda;
and the service rate &middot; number of agents &mu; &middot; c.
By term change the necessary number of agents can be determined 
to achieve a given work load for a given arrival and service rate.
</p>

<h2>Erlang B</h2>
<p>
The Erlang B formula gives the part of clients who will 
receives a busy signal when the traffic offered (=&lambda;/&mu;)
and the number of phone lines is known.
</p>

<h2>Erlang C</h2>
<p>
Using the Erlang C formula, you can calculate the part of clients who
will have to wait longer than a certain number of seconds.
For the Erlang C formula is assumed that both the interarrival times
and the service times are exponentially distributed. Neither forwarding nor
canceling clients nor retryers are considered.
</p>

<h2>Erlang C (extended)</h2>
<p>
The extended Erlang C formula differs from the ordinary Erlang C formula
that it models cancel waiting clients. It is assumed that the wait time tolerances
of the clients are exponentially distributed.
</p>

<h2>Allen-Cunneen</h2>
<p>
The Allen-Cunneen formula is an approximation formula for the parameters of a queuing system.
In contrast to the Erlang formulas it does not require that interarrival and service times are
exponentially distributed. Therefore here the coefficient of variation of these two parameters
has to be set explicitly.
</p>

<h2>Wartezeittoleranz</h2>
<p>
Assuming that the waiting time tolerance is exponentially distributed (which usually is
not the case), the average waiting time tolerance of the clients E[WT] can be calculated
as the quotient of the mean waiting time E[W] and the cancelation rate P(A).
This calculated value can be used as a first approximation for the waiting time tolerance
calibration.
