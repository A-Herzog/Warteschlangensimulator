<h1>Model element: Flow</h1>


<p>
A flow is a connection between two <a href="ModelElementTank.html">Tanks</a>
(or to be more precise between two valves at two different tanks).
Or between the flow source and a tank or between a tank and a flow destination.
</p>

<p>
A flow defines how many unit are to be transported from the source to the target
or how long the flow is to be active.
</p>

<p>
The flow will be activated by a client passing through the element.
</p>

<p>
The name of the flow element has no further meaning for the simulation.
For each flow, a source and a destination have to be specified.
It is also necessary to define how long the flow should be active.
The duration of activity can be defined as a time span, a flow quantity or by a stop signal.
