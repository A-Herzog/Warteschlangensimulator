<h1>Model element: Table</h1>

<p>
The table element allows to display data in table form during the animation of a model.
Any computable expression can be displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue lengths at
individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation variables). The output is in table form
on the drawing surface. For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
