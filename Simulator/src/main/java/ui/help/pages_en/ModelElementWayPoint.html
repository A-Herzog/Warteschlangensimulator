<h1>Model element: Transporter way point</h1>

<p>
Way points are visited by transporters during the animation on their way from an 
origin to a destination station. They have no meaning for the simulation itself.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
For each way point can be set on which routes from which origin to which
destination station they are to be visited.
</p>

<p>
<u>Node:</u><br>
Creating paths by editing the way point settings directly is very expensive.
To simplify this process the <a href="PathEditorDialog.html">paths editor</a>
which can be accessed via the context menu of a way point can be used.
