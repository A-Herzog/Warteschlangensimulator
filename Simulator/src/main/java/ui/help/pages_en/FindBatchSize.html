<h1>Determine statistics batch size</h1>

<p>
This function simulates the current model with autocorrelation detection turned on.
On this basis, suggestions are made for the batch length to be selected, so that
in each case certain threshold values are exceeded in relation to the autocorrelation
of measuring points that are not in the same batch. The observation of parameters
on a batch basis makes it possible to determine confidence intervals in later simulation runs.
