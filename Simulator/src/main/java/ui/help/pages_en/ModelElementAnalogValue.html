<h1>Model element: Analog value</h1>

<p>
The element contains a value which changes by a rate over the time.
The value and the rate can be changed during run time by a
<a href="ModelElementAnalogAssign.html">Change analog value</a> element.
</p>

<p>
If a minimum and a maximum value for the analog value are defined,
the <b>fill level</b> is drawn in the element shape.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the analog value element has no further meaning for the simulation.
Next to the initial value, the initial change rate and an optional minimum and maximum value
one can specify how often the discreet simulation should be informed about the change of
the continuous value.
