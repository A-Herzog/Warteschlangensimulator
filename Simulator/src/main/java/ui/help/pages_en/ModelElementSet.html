<h1>Model element: Variable</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, the variable assignments defined in
this element are executed. In all other elements in which expressions are evaluated,
especially in the <a href="ModelElementHold.html">Condition</a> element, these variables can be accessed.
</p>

<p>
Initial all variables are set to 0. By using assignments like <tt>a:=a+1</tt> counters can be realized.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the variable element has no further meaning.
The assignments are processed in the order in which they are defined in the element when a client passes the element.
</p> 

<p>
By using the pseudo variables "w", "t" and "p" you can access the waiting time, the transfer time and the
process time of the current client (each on second base) for reading and for writing. Additionally you can
write to a client object data field by using "ClientData(index)" as target variable.
</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>
The <a href="ModelElementSetJS.html">Javascript</a> element allows to define more complex assignment.
On the other side the Javascript element will need much more computing time to be executed during simulation.
