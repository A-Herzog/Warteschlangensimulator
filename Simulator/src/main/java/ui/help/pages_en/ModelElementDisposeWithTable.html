<h1>Model element: Save and exit</h1>

<p>
Any number of edges can be inserted into an exit element, but no edges run out of this element.
The exit represents the last station of a client in the queue system.
At this station, the client leaves the system, and no further processing is possible thereafter.
All the ways of the client have to end in such an element.
</p>

<p>
A Save and exit element stores the data of the individual clients in a table before they leave the system.
Tables generated in this way can be used at <a href="ModelElementSourceTable.html">table sources</a> stations
to use the clients who left the current system as an input stream in another model.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
For a Save and exit element, a file must be specified where clients are to be recorded before leaving the system.
</p>

<p>
The name of the exit element has no further meaning for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
The exit element can be defined as an emergency exit: In this mode, the simulation is aborted
as soon as a client arrives at the station.
