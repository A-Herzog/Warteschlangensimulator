<h1>Charts dashboard</h1>

<p>
The charts dashboard provides a special drawing surface where only diagrams and similar
elements which are not connected to the model flow chart elements can be inserted.
This drawing surface can be open in parallel during a running animation without blocking
the main drawing surface.
