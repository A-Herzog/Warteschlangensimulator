<h1>Javascript Scripting</h1>

<p>
Scripts can be used at different locations in the simulator.
As scripting language <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Java</b> can be used in all cases.
</p>

<p>
When using <b>Javascript</b> in addition to the standard language commands, the following special
objects are available for accessing the simulation or statistics data and the output
of the filtered data, depending on the context in which the script is executed:
</p>



<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>
The <tt>Statistics</tt> object offers read access to the xml elements which are the
base of the statistics data. The <tt>Statistics</tt> object is only available after the
simulation while filtering the results while and when running a parameter series Javascript.
The following methods are in this object available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>Statistics.setFormat("Format")</tt><br>
  This command allows to setup the format that is used in <tt>Statistics.xml</tt> for outputing numbers
  as strings. You can specify whether to use a floating point notation or percent notation or interpreting
  the value as a time. As default floating point notation is used.
  <ul>
    <li><tt>"System"</tt>: Using floating point notation for numbers and percent values</li>
    <li><tt>"Fraction"</tt>: Using floating point notation for numbers (<tt>0.375</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Percent":</tt> Using percent notation for numbers (<tt>35.7%</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Time"</tt>: Interpreting numbers as times (<tt>00:03:25.87</tt> for example)</li>
    <li><tt>"Number"</tt>:Interpreting time values as normal numbers (format defined by <tt>Percent</tt> or <tt>Fraction</tt>)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li><tt>Statistics.xmlNumber("Path")</tt><br>

  </li>
  <li><tt>Statistics.xmlArray("Path")</tt><br>
  Loads the xml field which is specified by the parameter, interprets it as a distribution and
  returns the values as an array of numbers.
  If the field cannot be interpreted as a distribution, a string containing an error message will be returned.<br>

  </li>
  <li><tt>Statistics.xmlSum("Path")</tt><br>
  Loads the xml field which is specified by the parameter, interprets it as a distribution and

  </li>
  <li><tt>Statistics.xmlMean("Path")</tt><br>
  Loads the xml field which is specified by the parameter, interprets it as a distribution and

  </li>
  <li><tt>Statistics.xmlSD("Path")</tt><br>
  Loads the xml field which is specified by the parameter, interprets it as a distribution and

<h2>XML selection commands</h2>

<p>
By the parameters of the functions of the <tt>Statistics</tt> object the content of the
value or of an attribute of an XML element can be read.
The selection of an XML element is done multistaged step by step divided by
"-&gt;" characters. Between the "-&gt;" characters the names of the individual XML nodes are
noted. In addition in square brackets names and values of attributes can be specified to filter by whom.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <tt>Statistics.xml("Model-&gt;ModelName")</tt><br>
    Shows the content of the element <tt>ModelName</tt>, which is a child element of <tt>Model</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>Statistics.xml("StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients-&gt;Station[Type=\"Source id=1\"]-&gt;[Mean]")</tt><br>
	Selects the <tt>Station</tt> sub element of the <tt>StatisticsInterArrivalTimesClients</tt> element, for
