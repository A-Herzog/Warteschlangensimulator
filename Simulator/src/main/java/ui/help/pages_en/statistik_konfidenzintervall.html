<h1>Confidence intervals</h1>

<p>
The individual measured values that result from the simulation and on the basis of which,
for example, <a href="statistik_mittelwert.html">average values</a> are calculated, represent
only some of the possible realizations that can occur in reality. Therefore the question is
often asked how close the mean value determined by simulation is to the actual mean value of
the model. The confidence intervals provide information on this.
</p>

<p>
A confidence interval is the interval around a measured average value in which the actual
average value is located with a certain probability. The smaller the confidence interval
is to be selected, the lower the probability that the actual average value lies within
this interval or the more measured values are required to fulfill this requirement. The
same applies to the probability that the actual average value lies within the interval
(also called confidence level): The higher the confidence level is selected, the larger the
associated confidence interval will be or, again, the more measured values will be required.

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>
To calculate a confidence interval it is necessary that the individual measured values are
<b>independent</b> of each other. This is usually not the case for the waiting times of
clients who follow each other directly. Therefore, the batch-means method is used here:
It is identified how far these dependencies extend. The number of clients from whose
distance the remaining dependency is below a reasonable threshold is then used as one
measured value to calculate the confidence interval, that is, the number of measured values
is divided by this number. The result is used as the number of independent measurements.
