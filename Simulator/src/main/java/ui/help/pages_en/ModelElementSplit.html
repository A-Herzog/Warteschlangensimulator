<h1>Model element: Split</h1>

<p>
If a client arrives at a Split station, its live cycle ends there just like
at an  <a href="ModelElementDispose.html">Exit</a>-Element.
Therefore one or more new clients are generated just like at a
einer <a href="ModelElementSourceMulti.html">Multi source</a> element.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the split element has no meaning for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
Per individual sub source the following settings can be made:
</p>

<p>
Per sub source a <b>name</b> for the client type of the clients to be generated has to be defined.
The dialog consists of a number of tabs which allow to setup the different properties of the client source:
</p>

<h3>Batch size</h3>

<p>
A batch size larger than 1 can be used to specify that, per arrival, not a single client,
but several clients should arrive at the same time. It is possible to set up the same number
of clients per arrival (fixed batch size) or a distribution of the rates according to which
the respective sizes of the arrival batches are to be determined.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of client variables</h3>

<p>
On this tab client variable assignment to variables like <tt>ClientData(nr)</tt> can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of texts</h3>

<p>
On this tab client text assignments like key:=value can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Transfer of client data from the source client</h3>
<p>
Independently of the settings per partial sub source, it is possible to set that
the numeric and text-based client data should be transferred from the source client
to the newly generated clients.
</p>

<h2>Load client types</h2>

<p>
If a large number of client types is to be used in a model, this function can be used
to load several client types from a table. Each table line contains the data for one client type.
</p>

<p>
The first column specifies the name of the client type, the second the definition of the inter-arrival times.
Thereby the inter-arrival times can be defined either by a calculation expression or by the definition of a
distribution. The format of the distributions is documented in the pdf document
"Distribution XML reference for Warteschlangensimulator". These two columns can be followed by any number
of additional columns with the following contents:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>batch=</tt><br>
  Specifies the arrival batch size. Either a positive integer can be specified, or a series of values separated
  by ";" of the form <tt>size=rate</tt> to define different rates for different batch sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally a assignment, that can be made at a <a href="ModelElementSourceTable.html">Table source</a>, can be used.
