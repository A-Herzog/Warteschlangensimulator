<h1>Model element: Split</h1>

<p>
If a client arrives at a Split station, its live cycle ends there just like
at an  <a href="ModelElementDispose.html">Exit</a>-Element.
Therefore one or more new clients are generated just like at a
einer <a href="ModelElementSourceMulti.html">Multi source</a> element.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the split element has no meaning for the simulation.
</p>

<p>
Per individual sub source the following settings can be made:
</p>

<p>
Per sub source a <b>name</b> for the client type of the clients to be generated has to be defined.
The dialog consists of a number of tabs which allow to setup the different properties of the client source:
</p>

<h3>Batch size</h3>

<p>
A batch size larger than 1 can be used to specify that, per arrival, not a single client,
but several clients should arrive at the same time. It is possible to set up the same number
of clients per arrival (fixed batch size) or a distribution of the rates according to which
the respective sizes of the arrival batches are to be determined.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of client variables</h3>

<p>
On this tab client variable assignment to variables like <tt>ClientData(nr)</tt> can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Assignment of texts</h3>

<p>
On this tab client text assignments like key:=value can be setup.
These assignments are applied to each client created by this source.
</p>

<h3>Transfer of client data from the source client</h3>
<p>
Independently of the settings per partial sub source, it is possible to set that
the numeric and text-based client data should be transferred from the source client
to the newly generated clients.
