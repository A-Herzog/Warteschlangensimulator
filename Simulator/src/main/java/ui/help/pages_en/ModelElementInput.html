<h1>Model element: Input</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, a numerical value is read from a file
and assigned to a variable. The reading position then is moved by one line.
If a client is reaching the end of the file, different actions can be processed.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the input element has no further meaning for the simulation.
You need to set up the name of the input file to be read, the intended behavior
at the end of the file and the name of the variable where the value is to
be assigned to.
</p> 

<p>
By using the pseudo variables "w", "t" and "p" you can access the waiting time, the transfer time and the
process time of the current client (each on second base) for reading and for writing. Additionally you can
write to a client object data field by using "ClientData(index)" as target variable or a text to a client-based
key by using "ClientData('key')".
</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>
The <a href="ModelElementInputJS.html">Input (JS)</a> element allows to define more complex processings
of the input values. On the other side the Javascript programs to be executed with the input values
will need much more computing time to be executed during simulation.
