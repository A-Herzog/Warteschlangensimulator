<h1>Layers dialog</h1>

<p>
The elements on the drawing surface can be assigned to different layers.
Each element can be assigned to multiple layers;
if all assignments are removed, the element is considered to belong to all layers.
An element is only displayed on the drawing surface if at least one of the layers on which it is located is visible.
