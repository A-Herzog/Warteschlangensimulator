<h1>Model element: Animation image</h1>

<p>
In the animation image element, several images can be specified
which are displayed during the animation of the model
depending on certain conditions.

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the animation image element has no further meaning.
You can define a condition for each picture. The list of images and conditions
is always processed from top to bottom during the animation.
The image corresponding to the first fulfilled condition is displayed.
If none of the specified conditions is true, the last image in the list
(to which no condition can be specified) will be displayed.
