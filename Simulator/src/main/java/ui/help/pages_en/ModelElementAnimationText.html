<h1>Model element: Simulation data as text</h1>

<p>
The simulation data as a text element allows to display data in text form during the animation of a model.
Any computable expression can be displayed (which includes the functions for determining queue lengths at
individual stations as well as access to all user-defined simulation variables). The output is in text form
on the drawing surface. For classical simulation, the simulation data elements are without further meaning.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the simulation data element is displayed on the drawing area directly above the value.
You can select whether the element should display the current simulation time or any computable expression.
If an expression is displayed, the numerical value can also optionally be displayed as a percentage
(i.e., 70% instead of 0.7).
