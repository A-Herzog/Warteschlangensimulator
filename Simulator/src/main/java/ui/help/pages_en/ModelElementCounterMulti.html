<h1>Model element: Multi counter</h1>

<p>
If a client passes through this element, depending on different conditions the value
of one counter is incremented by one. In this way, it is possible to measure how many
clients have chosen a specific path in the simulation model. A multi counter works
like a <a href="ModelElementDecide.html">decision</a> by expression element followed
by some normal <a href="ModelElementCounter.html">counter</a> elements.
</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
The name of the multi counter element has no meaning for the simulation. By choosing
a common group name for the counters in the statistics not only the absolute values
of the counters will be reported but also the relative part of each counter in its
group. If a client passes through this element, the given expressions will be checked
one after each other. The value of the counter for the first fullfilled condition will
be increased by one. If non of the conditions it met, the counter for the "else" case
will be increased.
