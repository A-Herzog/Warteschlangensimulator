<p>
The transport of clients between different transporter start and transport destination stations
is done by transporters, which can be organized in several transporter groups.
</p>

<p>
This page shows, for each group of transporters, how many transporters were working
at each time and how often. The <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average</a>
utilization of a transporter group is referred to as <b>rho</b>. In addition, the
other usual parameters such as <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviations</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Sk">skewness</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_Kurt">excess kurtosis</a> of the number of busy transporters
in the group are also given.
</p>

<p>
The time share in which all transporters were idle (<b>idle share (all transporters)</b>)
and the time share in which all transporters worked simultaneously (<b>full busy share</b>)
were also output.
