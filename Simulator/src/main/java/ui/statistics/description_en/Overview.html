This statistics page displays the <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average values</a>
of the most important indicators collected during the simulation. The identifier
<b>E[...]</b> stands for the average value (mathematically exact: expected value of
the corresponding distribution) of the parameter specified in brackets. The abbreviations
correspond to the parameters specified in the headings of the respective sections.
</p>

<h3>Retrieving further information</h3>
<p>
Below the texts in each sections, the word "<b>details</b>" is displayed in blue.
A click on this link leads to a statistics page, which provides further information
(e.g. <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung deviation">standard deviations</a> etc.)
on the respective topic.
</p>

<h3>Average number of clients</h3>
<p>
The average number of clients in the system or at a station is designated by <b>E[N]</b>.
For the collection of data for this <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average value</a>
it is irrelevant whether the clients are in the queue or in the service process.
</p>
<p>
The indicator <b>E[NQ]</b>, on the other hand, denotes the
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average value</a> of the number of <b>waiting</b> clients
(i.e. not in the service process) in the respective section.
</p>

<h3>Times</h3>
<p>
The times are recorded both across client types and from the station side.
The average waiting times (<b>E[W]</b>), the average transport times (<b>E[T]</b>),
if they occur, the average service or operating times (<b>E[S]</b>) and the average
residence time (<b>E[V]</b>) are recorded. The residence time of a client in the
system is the sum of the waiting time, the transfer time and the service time.
der Transportzeit und der Bedienzeit.
</p>

<h3>Flow factor</h3>
<p>
The flow factor is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
waiting and transfer times have occurred.
Large values indicate relatively long waiting and transfer times. 
</p>

<h3>Utilization</h3>
<p>
If <b>operators</b> or <b>transporters</b> are used in the simulation model,
their utilization is indicated. The value <b>rho</b> indicates the
average utilization of the respective group.
</p>

<h3>Counters and throughput</h3>
<p>
If counters or throughput counters are used in the model,
the basic parameters of these elements are also displayed on the overview page.
