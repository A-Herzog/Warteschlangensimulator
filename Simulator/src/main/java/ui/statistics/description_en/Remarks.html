<p>
This page lists remarks on parameters that are outside the normal range. These parameters should
then be given special attention when looking for bottle necks or inconsistencies in the model.
</p>

<p>
On this page, the following information can be output (depending on the specific value of each parameter):
</p>

<h3>Notices about errors or warnings</h3>.
<p>
If the simulation was aborted due to an error or if problems occurred during the simulation
that did not directly lead to an abortion of the simulation but were recorded as a warning,
these are output here. Since problems during the simulation often lead to unusable or invalid
results, the cause of these messages should be corrected in any case.
</p>

<h3>Many clients in the system</h3>
<p>
If there are very many clients at a station or in the system, this indicates an overload situation at the station or overall.
In addition, the mean number of clients at a station is set in relation to the average of the mean numbers of clients at the
other stations. If there are a particularly large number of clients on average at one station compared to the other stations,
this is also an indication of a possible misconfiguration of this station.
</p>

<h3>Long waiting times</h3>
<p>
If the mean wait times at one station are very high compared to the average over the mean wait times at the other stations,
this may mean that this station is a bottleneck.
</p>

<h3>High flow factors</h3>
<p>
The flow factor is the quotient of the residence time to service time at a station.
A flow factor of 1 means that no waiting times occurred. The higher the flow factor,
the more waiting times have occurred (relative to the service time).
High flow factors are therefore an indication of a poorly dimensioned system.
Both high flow factors in absolute terms and when the flow factor at one station deviates
significantly upward from the average of flow factors over all stations are indicated.
</p>

<h3>High coefficients of variation of the residence times</h3>
<p>
High coefficients of variation of the residence times mean that it is very difficult to predict
the throughput times of clients by the system. Therefore, in real systems one usually tries to
avoid high coefficients of variation of the residence times. If such values occur in the
simulation as a whole, at a station, or for a client type, the simulator shows a warning.
</p>

<h3>High operator utilization</h3>
<p>
Very high operator workloads usually result in long client waiting times and should therefore be avoided.
If the workload of an operator group is particularly high in absolute terms, or if the workload of an
operator group is particularly high in relation to the workloads of the other operator groups,
a corresponding warning is issued.
