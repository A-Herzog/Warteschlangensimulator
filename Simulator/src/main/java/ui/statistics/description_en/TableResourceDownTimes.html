<p>Bedeutung der Spalten in dieser Tabelle:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Resource</b>:
  Operator group to which the respective line refers.  
  </li>
  <li><b>Number of operators</b>:
  Number of operators in the respective group, if this is determined by
  a fixed number (and not, for example, by a shift schedule).
  </li>  
  <li><b>Share in down time</b>:
  If the number of operators in this group is a fixed value during simulation,
  this cell indicates the <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average share of operators</a> in the operator group who are in down time.
  </li>    
  <li><b>Mean</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">Average absolute number</a> of operators in this group in down time.
  </li>
  <li><b>Std</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">Standard deviation</a> of the absolute number of operators in down time in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Var</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">Variance</a> of the absolute number of operators in down time in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>CV</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_CV">Coefficient of variation</a> of the absolute number of operators in down time in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Sk</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_Sk">Skewness</a> of the absolute number of operators in down time in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Kurt</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_Kurt">Excess kurtosis</a> of the absolute number of operators in down time in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Min</b>:
  Minimum absolute number of operators in down time during the simulation in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Max</b>:
  Maximum absolute number of operators in down time during the simulation in this group.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The value <b>share in down time</b> indicates the ratio between the operators in down time and the total number of available operators.
If the number of available operators in the group is either variable (defined by a shift plan)
or if the group consists of an infinite number of operators, no share can be determined.
</p>
<p>
Values that refer to the <b>absolute number of operators in down time</b>, however, are always available.
