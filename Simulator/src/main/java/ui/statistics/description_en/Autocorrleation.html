It is often desirable not only to output characteristics such as the
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert value">average value</a> over the
measured values recorded during a simulation (e.g. for the
average waiting times of the clients), but also to be able to evaluate
with what degree of certainty the actual, long-term average value of
this quantity is located with what probability and how close to the
experimentally determined value. This is achieved by the so-called
<a href="help:statistik_konfidenzintervall"><b>confidence intervals</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
The formula for calculating a confidence interval uses the measured average value,
the measured <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung deviation">standard deviation</a>
of the values and the number of independent measured values. The first two characteristics
are recorded for all relevant properties during the simulation. However, determining how
many <b>independent</b> measured values there are is less easy: If a client had to wait
a long time, it is highly probable that the next client will also have to wait quite a
long time. Conversely, a short waiting time for one client means that the immediately
following client will also not have to wait very long. This dependency between the waiting
times of clients is called the <b>autocorrelation</b>. For the determination of confidence
intervals it is therefore of relevance to know, the distance from which on
the <b>remaining autocorrelation</b> is below a value
that can be considered acceptable. The total number of arrivals is then divided
by this distance to obtain a number of at least approximately independent measured values.

<p>
The value <b>min{k|rho(k)&lt;10%}</b> mean: The smallest distance <b>k</b> from which
on the remaining autocorrelation <b>rho(k)</b> is less than 10%. Usually a remaining
autocorrelation of 5% is accepted for the calculation of confidence intervals, i.e.
the value output at <b>min{k|rho(k)&lt;5%}</b> is used.
