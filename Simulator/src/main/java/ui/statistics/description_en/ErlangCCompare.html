<h3>Erlang-C formula</h3>

<p>
By using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution">Erlang-C formula</a>
the relevant performance indicators of simple queueing models like average waiting, service
and residence times (E[W], E[S] and E[V]), the number of clients in the system, in the
queue and in the service process (E[N], E[NQ] and E[NS]) as well as the utilization of the
operators &rho; can be calculated exactly. In this context "simple" means the model needs
to have the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inter-arrival times are exponential distributed.</li>
  <li>The service times are exponential distributed.</li>
  <li>There is a fixed number of operators.</li>
  <li>There are not other special properties (like different client types, batch arrival,
  batch service, branching between stations, ...).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The classical Erlang-C formula cannot represent clients impatience.
But the extended Erlang-C formula can represent impatience, so the
following property may also prevail in a simple model:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optionally, clients are only willing to wait for a limited time. If this is the case,
  it waiting time tolerance has to be exponential distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A corresponding model is then called <b>M/M/c</b> or <b>M/M/c/ infinity+M</b> model.
</p>

<p>
If the queueing model to be simulated is simple enough so that the simulator can establish
a clear relationship between the simulated model and the Erlang-C model, it compares the
simulation results with the Erlang-C values. If the simulated model fulfills all above
mentioned conditions to an Erlang-C model, the differences between simulation results
and theoretical results are very small (typically &lt;1%). If there are properties in the
simulated model that are not covered by the Erlang-C formula, significant deviations between
the formula results and the simulation results can be expected.
</p> 

<h3>Allen-Cunneen approximation formula</h3>

<p>
The Allen-Cunneen approximation formula allows a relaxation of the restrictions defined
in the Erlang-C model: Instead of exponentially distributed inter-arrival and service times,
<b>any distributions</b> characterized by their expected value and coefficient of variation
are now allowed. In addition, <b>batch arrivals</b> and <b>batch service</b> are allowed.
(The batch sizes are denoted by b(I) and b(S).) For this, the absolute accuracy has to be
given up, i.e. even with a model which complies with all specifications of the Allen-Cunneen
approximation formula, differences between the approximation formula results and the
simulation reality have to be expected.
</p>

<p>
Also for the Allen-Cunneen approximation formula the results are also shown and the
deviation between the formula results and the simulation results are shown here.
