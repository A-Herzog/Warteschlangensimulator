This diagram shows the <b>utilization</b> of the individual transporter groups.
Each stacked bar represents one transporter group. The bars are divided into
areas for the average number of working transporters, transporters in idle time
and transporters in pause time. On the y-axis the average values are displayed
as absolute numbers of transporters.
