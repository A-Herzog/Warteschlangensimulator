<p>
An inter-leave time is the time span between the times
when two immediately consecutive clients <b>have left the system</b>.
(The "immediately following each other" refers to the departure times
of the clients, not to the previous times of the arrivals).

<h2>Confidence intervals</h2>
<p>
For the performance indicators displayed on this page, confidence intervals can optionally be output.
To calculate confidence intervals, the individual measured values have to be stochastically independent,
which is usually not the case with the indicators recorded in a queueing system. In order to be able to
determine confidence intervals in spite of this, a fixed number of values is therefore combined to form
a batch. The batch sizes are chosen in such a way that (almost) no dependencies exist between them.
(This virtual grouping of measured values has nothing to do with arrival or service batches).
The mean values per batch are then used as input variable for the calculation of the confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>
The recording of batch-means-based confidence intervals can be activated on the <b>Output analysis</b> page
in the <b>Model properties</b> dialog. A batch size has to be specified for this. This can be determined
automatically in advance via the menu item <b>Determine statistics batch size</b> in the <b>Simulation</b> menu.
