<h3>Number of arrivals</h3>

<p>
This section shows how many clients have arrived at the respective stations
during the entire simulation. Since the simulation is terminated at a point
in time when clients are in the system (at different stations), even in a strictly
linear model the results for the number of arrived clients at the different station
can slightly differ.
</p>

<h3>Inter-arrival times</h3>

<p>
An inter-arrival time is the time span <b>between the arrival</b> of
two immediately consecutive clients at a station.

<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_quantil">quantiles</a> are displayed.
</p>

<p>
The average inter-arrival time is designated by <b>E[I]</b>
(and is measured in seconds or minutes, for example). The
reciprocal of E[I] is the <b>arrival rate</b>. It is
designated by <b>lambda</b> (&lambda;) (measured in e.g.
1/second or 1/minute). Small values of E[I] or large values
of lambda mean that many clients arrive within a short time.
