If <b>Counter</b> stations are used in the model, the counter readings
at the end of the simulation are output on this page. If several of the
counters are combined to a group, the share of each counter in its group
is also shown. This can be used, for example, to record how many clients
(total and proportional) have followed certain paths in the model.
