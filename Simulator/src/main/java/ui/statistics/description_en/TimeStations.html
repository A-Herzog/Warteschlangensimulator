The waiting, transfer and service times are not only displayed
for clients on their way through the system, but the stations
also measure the time taken by the different types. In the case
of a model with only one station, the waiting times across all
clients correspond to the waiting times at the station etc. In
the case of a model with several process stations, the total
waiting times at all process units correspond to the total
waiting times collected from all clients. Within a station,
the times are recorded in total as well as subdivided again
according to client types. On this page, the total data
within a station is displayed.

The average <b> waiting times</b> are designated by <b>E[W]</b>,
the average <b>transfer times</b> are designated by <b>E[T]</b>
and the average <b>service times</b> are designated by <b>E[S]</b>.

For all time entries
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average values</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviations</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Sk">skewness</a> and

<p>
The <b>flow factor</b> is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
waiting and transfer times have occurred.
Large values indicate relatively long waiting and transfer times.
