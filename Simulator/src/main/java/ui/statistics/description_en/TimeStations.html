<p>
The waiting, transfer and service times are not only displayed
for clients on their way through the system, but the stations
also measure the time taken by the different types. In the case
of a model with only one station, the waiting times across all
clients correspond to the waiting times at the station etc. In
the case of a model with several process stations, the total
waiting times at all process units correspond to the total
waiting times collected from all clients. Within a station,
the times are recorded in total as well as subdivided again
according to client types. On this page, the total data
within a station is displayed.

<p>
The average <b> waiting times</b> are designated by <b>E[W]</b>,
the average <b>transfer times</b> are designated by <b>E[T]</b>,
the average <b>service times</b> are designated by <b>E[S]</b> and
the average <b>setup times</b> are designated by <b>E[Setup]</b>.
If setup times have occurred, it should be noted, that these are
also counted as service times, i.e. are also included in these.
</p>

<p>
For all time entries
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average values</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviations</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Sk">skewness</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Kurt">excess kurtosis</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_quantil">quantiles</a> are displayed.
</p>

<p>
The <b>flow factor</b> is the ratio of the residence time to the service time.
Consequently, the flow factor is always greater than or equal to 1.
Small values mean that in relation to the service time only little
waiting and transfer times have occurred.
Large values indicate relatively long waiting and transfer times.

<h2>Confidence intervals</h2>
<p>
For the performance indicators displayed on this page, confidence intervals can optionally be output.
To calculate confidence intervals, the individual measured values have to be stochastically independent,
which is usually not the case with the indicators recorded in a queueing system. In order to be able to
determine confidence intervals in spite of this, a fixed number of values is therefore combined to form
a batch. The batch sizes are chosen in such a way that (almost) no dependencies exist between them.
(This virtual grouping of measured values has nothing to do with arrival or service batches).
The mean values per batch are then used as input variable for the calculation of the confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>
The recording of batch-means-based confidence intervals can be activated on the <b>Output analysis</b> page
in the <b>Model properties</b> dialog. A batch size has to be specified for this. This can be determined
automatically in advance via the menu item <b>Determine statistics batch size</b> in the <b>Simulation</b> menu.
