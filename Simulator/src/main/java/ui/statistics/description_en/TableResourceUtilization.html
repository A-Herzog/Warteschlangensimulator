<p>Meaning of the columns in this table:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Resource</b>:
  Operator group to which the respective line refers.  
  </li>
  <li><b>Number of operators</b>:
  Number of operators in the respective group, if this is determined by
  a fixed number (and not, for example, by a shift schedule).
  </li>
  <li><b>rho</b>:
  If the number of operators in this group is a fixed value during simulation,
  rho indicates the <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average utilization</a> of the operator group.
  </li>    
  <li><b>Average busy</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">Average absolute number</a> of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Std</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">Standard deviation</a> of the absolute number of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Var</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">Variance</a> of the absolute number of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>CV</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_CV">Coefficient of variation</a> of the absolute number of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Sk</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_Sk">Skewness</a> of the absolute number of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Kurt</b>:
  <a href="help:statistik_Kurt">Excess kurtosis</a> of the absolute number of working operators in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Min</b>:
  Minimum absolute number of working operators during the simulation in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Max</b>:
  Maximum absolute number of working operators during the simulation in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Idle share (all operators)</b>:
  Outputs the part of time during which not a single operator in the group was working.
  </li>
  <li><b>Full busy share</b>:
  If the number of operators in this group is a fixed value during the simulation,
  this cell indicates the part of time during which all operators were busy.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The value <b>rho</b> indicates the ratio between busy and total available operators.
If the number of available operators in the group is either variable (defined by a shift plan)
or if the group consists of an infinite number of operators, no value can be determined for rho.
The same applies to the <b>full load share</b>: If there is no fixed number of available operators,
no time share in which this number was busy can be output.
</p>
<p>
Values that refer to the <b>absolute number of busy operators</b>, however, are always available.
