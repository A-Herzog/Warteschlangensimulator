<p>
In this table a <b>frequency distribution</b> of one or more state variables is output.
In the first column of each row, the state value to which the row refers is given.
The other columns show the proportion of the simulation time that the system was in the respective state.
</p>

<p>
The relative frequencies displayed in the <b>last row</b> refer to the state value
displayed in the first column <b>and all larger values</b>. This means that the
relative frequencies in the last row form the totals for all state values that
are greater than the values specified previously.
