<p>
The waiting, transfer and service times are not only displayed
for clients on their way through the system, but the stations
also measure the time taken by the different types. In the case
of a model with only one station, the waiting times across all
clients correspond to the waiting times at the station etc. In
the case of a model with several process stations, the total
waiting times at all process units correspond to the total
waiting times collected from all clients. Within a station,
the times are recorded in total as well as subdivided again
according to client types. This page shows the data within
a station <b>divided according to client types</b>.
</p>

<p>
The average <b> waiting times</b> are designated by <b>E[W]</b>,
the average <b>transfer times</b> are designated by <b>E[T]</b>
and the average <b>service times</b> are designated by <b>E[S]</b>.
