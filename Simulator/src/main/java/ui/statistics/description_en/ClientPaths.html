<p>
If the paths of the individual clients through the model are recorded during the simulation,
all paths taken by at least one client are shown on this page and it is indicated how often the
respective path was taken in absolute and relative terms with respect to all clients.
</p>

<p>
In this way it can be traced whether the clients move through the
system as planned during the modelling.
