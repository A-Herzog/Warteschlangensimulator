<p>
If the simulation is split over multiple CPU cores, each thread does not simulate a fixed number of arrivals,
but the arrivals are assigned dynamically according to the respective simulation progress of the respective thread.
This allows the available CPU power to be optimally utilized. This page shows how many arrivals each thread has processed.
