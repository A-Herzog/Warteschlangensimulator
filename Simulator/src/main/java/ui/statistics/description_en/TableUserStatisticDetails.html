<p>
This table shows a <b>frequency distribution</b> of the values of the user-defined statistics stations.
In the first column of each row, the status value to which the row refers is given.
The other columns show how often this value was observed (absolute and relative).
</p>

<p>
The relative frequencies displayed in the <b>last row</b> refer to the state value
displayed in the first column <b>and all larger values</b>. This means that the
relative frequencies in the last row form the totals for all state values that
are greater than the values specified previously.
