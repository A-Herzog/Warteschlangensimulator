<p>
Clients are served at the process stations by operators,
who can be organized in several resource groups.
The operators are not necessarily permanently assigned
to one process station. 
</p>

<p>
This page shows, for each group of resources, how many operators were working
at each time and how often. The <a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average</a>
utilization of a resource group is referred to as <b>rho</b>. In addition, the
other usual parameters such as <a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviations</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_Sk">skewness</a> of the number of busy operators
in the group are also given.
</p>

<p>
The time share in which all operators were idle (<b>idle share (all operators)</b>)
and the time share in which all operators worked simultaneously (<b>full busy share</b>)
were also output.
