<p>
This table shows a <b>frequency distribution</b> of one or more temporal quantities.
In the first column of each row, the seconds value to which the row refers is displayed.
The other columns show how often the respective seconds value for the respective quantity
occurred during the simulation (absolute and relative).
</p>

<p>
The frequency values displayed in the <b>last row</b> refer to the second value displayed
in the first column <b>and all larger values</b>. This means that the frequency values in
the last row collect all values that are larger than the seconds values specified in the previous row.
