The value specified by <b>Arrivals according to model</b> corresponds to
the number of clients to be simulated as specified in the model properties.
However, the value <b>Arrivals according to simulation</b> can deviate slightly.
The background is the way in which the simulation is ended: Unless otherwise
configured, all arrivals are counted. If the target number is reached, the
system continues to generate arrivals, but marks these clients as "last client".
As soon as one of these "last clients" has reached an exit, the simulation is
terminated. By then, in most cases some more clients beyond the defined number
will have been generated.

<h3>Inter-arrival times</h3>

<p>
An inter-arrival time is the time span <b>between the arrival</b> of
two immediately consecutive clients at the system.

<p>
The average inter-arrival time is designated by <b>E[I]</b>
(and is measured in seconds or minutes, for example). The
reciprocal of E[I] is the <b>arrival rate</b>. It is
designated by <b>lambda</b> (&lambda;) (measured in e.g.
1/second or 1/minute). Small values of E[I] or large values
of lambda mean that many clients arrive within a short time.
