<p>
The value specified by <b>Arrivals according to model</b> corresponds to
the number of clients to be simulated as specified in the model properties.
However, the value <b>Arrivals according to simulation</b> can deviate slightly.
The background is the way in which the simulation is ended: Unless otherwise
configured, all arrivals are counted. If the target number is reached, the
system continues to generate arrivals, but marks these clients as "last client".
As soon as one of these "last clients" has reached an exit, the simulation is
terminated. By then, in most cases some more clients beyond the defined number
will have been generated.

<h3>Inter-arrival times</h3>

<p>
An inter-arrival time is the time span <b>between the arrival</b> of
two immediately consecutive clients at the system.
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">Average value</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">variances</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Sk">skewness</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_Kurt">excess kurtosis</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_quantil">quantiles</a> are displayed.
</p>

<p>
The average inter-arrival time is designated by <b>E[I]</b>
(and is measured in seconds or minutes, for example). The
reciprocal of E[I] is the <b>arrival rate</b>. It is
designated by <b>lambda</b> (&lambda;) (measured in e.g.
1/second or 1/minute). Small values of E[I] or large values
of lambda mean that many clients arrive within a short time.

<h2>Confidence intervals</h2>
<p>
For the performance indicators displayed on this page, confidence intervals can optionally be output.
To calculate confidence intervals, the individual measured values have to be stochastically independent,
which is usually not the case with the indicators recorded in a queueing system. In order to be able to
determine confidence intervals in spite of this, a fixed number of values is therefore combined to form
a batch. The batch sizes are chosen in such a way that (almost) no dependencies exist between them.
(This virtual grouping of measured values has nothing to do with arrival or service batches).
The mean values per batch are then used as input variable for the calculation of the confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>
The recording of batch-means-based confidence intervals can be activated on the <b>Output analysis</b> page
in the <b>Model properties</b> dialog. A batch size has to be specified for this. This can be determined
automatically in advance via the menu item <b>Determine statistics batch size</b> in the <b>Simulation</b> menu.
