This diagram shows the <b>utilization</b> of the individual operator groups.
Each stacked bar represents one operator group. The bars are divided into
areas for the average number of working operators, operators in idle time
and operators in pause time. On the y-axis the average values are displayed
as absolute numbers of operators.
