In this model, clients arrive in groups (batch arrivals) and are also served in groups (batch service). Batch arrivals lead to an increase in the variation coefficient of the inter-arrival times. As a result of batch service, it can happen that the operator is idle and while clients still have to wait (as the target batch size has not yet been reached). The effect increases as the service batch size increases. However, this deterioration does not occur evenly, but in stages depending on the ratio of arrival and service batch size.
