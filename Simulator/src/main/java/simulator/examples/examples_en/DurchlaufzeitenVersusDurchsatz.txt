In pull production as illustrated in this model, a new workpiece is only released for processing at an process station if there is sufficient free capacity at the next station. In this example, the capacity of the buffer before station B can be configured. The larger the buffer, the less often the process station is idle and the higher the throughput - but also the longer the lead times for the workpieces.
