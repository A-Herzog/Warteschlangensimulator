The bus-stop paradox is a well-known phenomenon from queuing theory. If passengers arrive at random times at a stop where buses whose departure times are controlled by inter-arrival times and not by a fixed timetable arrive, the average waiting time for a passenger is not half the average inter-arrival time of the buses, but is usually longer. The reason for this is that it is more likely for a passenger to arrive during a long interval than during a short interval.
