In this model, there are two client types (A and B) waiting in a common queue. The clients are served at three service stations: One for type A clients only, one for type B clients only and one for all clients. If several suitable service stations are available, clients are preferentially directed to the specialized service stations (in order to keep the flexible service station as available as possible).
