If the utilization of capacity between differently priced process stations is to be differentiated as much as possible, this can be done using appropriate allocation strategies. If this is not sufficient, additional minimum waiting times can be used before the more expensive station can be accessed. In contrast to pure allocation strategies, however, these worsen the client-specific parameters of the system.
