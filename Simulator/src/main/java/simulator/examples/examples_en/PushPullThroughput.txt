Buffers in front of stations can ensure that a station can continue to work even if the previous station fails at short notice. On the other hand, high stock levels can mean that additional effort is required for restacking in order to comply with the FIFO operating sequence, i.e. that the service times increase. In this example model, the effects of small or large buffers can be analyzed.
