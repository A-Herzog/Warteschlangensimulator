This model examines how the processing policy (FIFO or LIFO) affects the performance indicators of a system: In the FIFO case, the variance of waiting times is lower than in the LIFO case. However, the model is configured in such a way that the service times in FIFO mode increase with increasing queue length. Therefore, at a certain (configurable) point, the system switches to the faster LIFO mode.
