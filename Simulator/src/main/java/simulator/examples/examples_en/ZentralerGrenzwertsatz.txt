In this example model, each client passes through a delay station 10 times, at which an exponentially distributed waiting time occurs. The histogram of the total waiting times of the clients is shown, i.e. the histogram of the sums of 10 exponentially distributed random numbers. This sum distribution approximates a normal distribution. This is the statement of the central limit theorem.
