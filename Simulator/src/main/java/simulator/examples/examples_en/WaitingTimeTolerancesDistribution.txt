Waiting cancelation occur particularly in customer service systems. When setting up a simulation model, the average waiting time tolerance of clients has to be mapped in the model. However, only the waiting time tolerance of the clients who cancel waiting can be measured directly - namely their cancelation time. In contrast, only a lower estimate of the waiting time tolerance of the successful clients is known (namely their actual waiting time). The example shows that neither time duration provides a valid estimate of the actual average waiting time tolerance across all clients. This is particularly due to the fact that those who cancel waiting tend to have a short waiting time tolerance and are therefore are not representative for the population as a whole.
