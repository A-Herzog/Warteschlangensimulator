If the clients arrive at the process station directly after their arrival at the system, there are only minimal waiting times for the clients, but the operator has to frequently switch back and forth between operation and idling. In this example model, all arriving clients are initially collected and directed to the process station every 15 minutes on a time-controlled basis. This can then process all clients who have arrived by then (longer working phase) and then has a longer idle phase. This procedure is similar to batch operation; however, clients are not released based on their number, but at fixed intervals.
