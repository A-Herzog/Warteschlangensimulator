Normally, only the clients move as objects through the queueing network defined as a flow chart. The operators - even if they can work at different stations - do not appear as independent objects. In this example model, however, the operators are also modeled as independent objects. Specifically, the model consists of an open queueing network for the clients and a closed system in which the operators move.
