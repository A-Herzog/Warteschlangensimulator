In some production systems, products are split into several components, which are processed individually and independently and then reassembled with the correct other components of the original product. One example is the repair of a laptop. In this example, various products arrive at the system. These are first given a unique ID and then split into two or three components (which are given the ID of the original product). After processing, the subcomponents are reassembled correctly according to their IDs.
