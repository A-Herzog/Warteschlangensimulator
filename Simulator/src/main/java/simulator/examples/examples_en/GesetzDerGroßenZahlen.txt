The law of large numbers states that the mean value resulting from the repeated execution of a random experiment (time mean) stabilizes against the expected value of the corresponding probability distribution (spatial mean). In this example model, a discrete uniform distribution with four possible outcomes is depicted. The probability that a client chooses one of the four possible paths stabilizes to 25%.
