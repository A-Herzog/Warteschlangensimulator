If there is only a limited buffer available in front of the process stations, a certain proportion of incoming clients will be blocked. In this example model, a queueing model consisting of two stations connected in series, each with an (adjustable) limited buffer in front of both stations, is considered. Station A only accepts clients if it is certain that they can be forwarded to station B later, i.e. no clients are rejected within the system. However, they are sorted out directly at the entrance.
