Transporting workpieces using transporters is a modeling option that is particularly advantageous for displaying the model in an animation. It is possible to see directly how the workpieces are moved between the stations using small vehicles. If the transporters are requested at a station, they may have to drive to the station empty first. This means that the modeling largely corresponds to the real behavior of transporting workpieces using vehicles.
