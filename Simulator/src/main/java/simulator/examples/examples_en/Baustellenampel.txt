A construction site traffic light that controls traffic through a single-lane area is an example of campaign production: The longer the respective traffic light phases are, the less often it is necessary to switch between directions and the more time can ultimately be used productively. However, the longer arriving cars have to wait on average until the traffic light for their direction turns green.
