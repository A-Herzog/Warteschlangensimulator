The principle "Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages" (PASTA) means that if the performance indicators of a system are only recorded at the times of client arrivals (instead of continuously), the same performance indicator will arise as with continuous recording if the inter-arrival times of the clients are subject to the exponential distribution. This situation is visualized in the example model.
