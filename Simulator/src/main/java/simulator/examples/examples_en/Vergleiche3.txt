If a client has to choose one of two queues when entering the system and this is done at random (e.g. because the client cannot see the actual queue lengths), the operator may end up idling at one station while clients have to wait at the other. If the client can see the queue lengths and selects the shorter one, this mitigates the effect. However, it can still occur due to the stochastic service times. The most efficient solution is therefore a shared queue in which clients are only assigned to one or the other station immediately before the service counters. These three control alternatives are considered in this example model.
