In this example, four service alternatives are compared in which the same operation capacity is available: An service system at which two parallel operators are active, two individual process stations with a 50:50 split of arriving clients at the start of the system, a process station with an operator twice as fast and a process station at which two clients are always served simultaneously (batch operations) are considered. Despite an identical arrival rate and mathematically identical service performance, different values for the average waiting times result.
