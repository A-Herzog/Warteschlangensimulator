"Jockeying" refers to the process when a customer at the very end of a queue notices that their neighboring queue has become significantly shorter and therefore changes queues. In the example model, arriving customers initially select the shorter of two queues. However, if they later notice that the other queue has become shorter than their own, the last customer switches to the shorter queue.
