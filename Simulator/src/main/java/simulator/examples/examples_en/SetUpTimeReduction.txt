In this example model, two production strategies are compared: Clients of two different types arrive at the system. They are served at three process stations, each with one operator. When changing from one client type to another, an additional set-up time is required at the process stations. In the upper model, incoming clients are assigned to the process stations according to the shortest queue length. In the lower model, if several stations are idle, the one for which no set-up time is required is selected if possible.
