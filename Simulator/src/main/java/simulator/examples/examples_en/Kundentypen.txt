In this example model, clients of two different types arrive at a service station. In principle, clients are served according to the FIFO principle, i.e. according to the longest waiting time. However, clients of type B, who are to be prioritized higher than clients of type A, are given a virtual head start in the queue. This head start can be configured in the model; the effects in the form of the difference of the average waiting times by client type are displayed as a diagram.
