The economy of scale states that a larger system delivers better key performance indicators than a smaller system with the same relative utilization. In the example model, 5 models are compared, which differ only in the average inter-arrival time and the number of operators. The number of operators is increased to the same extent as the average inter-arrival times are reduced, so that a relative utilization of 80% is always maintained. It can be seen that the waiting times in the larger models are shorter than in the smaller models.
