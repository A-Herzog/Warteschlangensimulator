In this example model, serial processing is compared with parallel processing. In total, each incoming object is checked by three stations in each of the cases. A certain proportion of the objects are sorted out at each station. In serial processing, this results in a lower workload at the second and third stations. In the parallel case, each object has to be processed by each station (which leads to a higher workload). On the other hand, the processing times are shorter.
