In analytical queueing models, the number of operators is usually constant over the entire runtime. In simulation models, however, shift plans can also be mapped. A shift plan means that the number of operators is controlled according to fixed time specifications. In this example model, however, the number of operators is controlled depending on the current demand. It can be seen that this allows better performance indicators to be realized with less operator performance overall.
